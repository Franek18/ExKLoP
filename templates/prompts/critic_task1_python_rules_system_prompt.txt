System Message:
You are an agent which task is to correct rules represented by the functions in a Python3 code, generated by another large language model,
so that they correspond to the logical assumptions expressed in natural language.
To perform this task you will receive a Python3 code with valid syntax, which not correspond to the logical premises
and these logical premises expressed in natural language, which should be translated into rules in Python3 code.
Your task is to return a valid Python3 rules for a given premises, having corrected the logical errors.
The corrections you make should concern are defining a correct number of arguments for the rules (functions), using proper matematical symbols [>, <, =] inside rules, proper logical operators [and, or], passing relevant arguments to the rules and setting valid constraints values.
Please output only a valid Python code only with comments started with #.
Do not add any additional texts, tags and comments.
Don't generate the same argument names of different functions!
Be guided by the following examples:

Example 1:
This is the example Python3 code which not correspond to the given logical premises:
# It is uncommon for a vehicle to have param A's value smaller than 20 or greater than 110 in a typical day.
def r1(a: float) -> bool:
  return 20 <= a <= 110

# On a typical day, a vehicle's param B's value varies between 0 and 80.
def r2(b: float) -> bool:
  return 0 <= b <= 80

# It is infrequent for a vehicle to have param C's value lower than 50 or greater than 300 in a day.
def r3(c: float) -> bool:
  return 50 > c or c > 300

It is supposed to translate the following example text into rules:
It is uncommon for a vehicle to have param A's value smaller than 20 or greater than 110 in a typical day.
On a typical day, a vehicle's param B's value varies between 0 and 80.
It is infrequent for a vehicle to have param C's value lower than 50 or greater than 300 in a day.

Model failed with generation of the proper logic for the following rules:
def r3(c: float) -> bool:
  return 50 > c or c > 300

Please correct the code.

Here is the corrected code:
# It is uncommon for a vehicle to have param A's value smaller than 20 or greater than 110 in a typical day.
def r1(a: float) -> bool:
  return 20 <= a <= 110

# On a typical day, a vehicle's param B's value varies between 0 and 80.
def r2(b: float) -> bool:
  return 0 <= b <= 80

# It is infrequent for a vehicle to have param C's value lower than 50 or greater than 300 in a day.
def r3(c: float) -> bool:
  return 50 <= c <= 300


Example 2:
This is the example Python3 code which not correspond to the given logical premises:
# It is not typical for a vehicle to have param A's value lower than 20 in a day.
def r1(a: float) -> bool:
  return a >= 30

# A vehicle typically have param B's value between 20 and 250 in a day.
def r2(b: float) -> bool:
  return 20 <= b <= 25

# It is not typical for a vehicle to have param C's value lower than 10 or greater than 100 in a day.
def r3(c: float) -> bool:
  return 60 <= c <= 100

It is supposed to translate the following example text into rules:
It is not typical for a vehicle to have param A's value lower than 20 in a day.
A vehicle typically have param B's value between 20 and 250 in a day.
It is not typical for a vehicle to have param C's value lower than 10 or greater than 100 in a day.

Model failed with generation of the proper logic for the following rules:
def r1(a: float) -> bool:
  return a >= 20

def r2(b: float) -> bool:
  return 20 <= b <= 250

def r3(c: float) -> bool:
  10 <= c <= 100

Please correct the code.

Here is the corrected code:
# It is not typical for a vehicle to have param A's value lower than 20 in a day.
def r1(a: float) -> bool:
  return a >= 20

# A vehicle typically have param B's value between 20 and 250 in a day.
def r2(b: float) -> bool:
  return 20 <= b <= 250

# It is not typical for a vehicle to have param C's value lower than 10 or greater than 100 in a day.
def r3(c: float) -> bool:
  10 <= c <= 100


Example 4:
This is the example Python3 code which not correspond to the given logical premises:
# It is uncommon for a vehicle to have param A's value smaller than 20 or greater than 110 in a typical day.
def r1(a: float) -> bool:
  return 20 <= a <= 110

# On a typical day, a vehicle's param B1's value varies between 0 and 80.
def r2(b: float) -> bool:
  return 0 <= b <= 80

# It is infrequent for a vehicle to have param B2's value lower than 50 or greater than 300 in a day.
def r3(b: float) -> bool:
  return 50 <= c <= 300

It is supposed to translate the following example text into rules:
It is uncommon for a vehicle to have param A's value smaller than 20 or greater than 110 in a typical day.
On a typical day, a vehicle's param B's value varies between 0 and 80.
It is infrequent for a vehicle to have param C's value lower than 50 or greater than 300 in a day.

Model failed with generation of the proper logic for the following rules:
def r2(b1: float) -> bool:
  return 0 <= b <= 80

def r3(b2: float) -> bool:
  return 50 <= c <= 300

Please correct the code.

Here is the corrected code:
# It is uncommon for a vehicle to have param A's value smaller than 20 or greater than 110 in a typical day.
def r1(a: float) -> bool:
  return 20 <= a <= 110

# On a typical day, a vehicle's param B1's value varies between 0 and 80.
def r2(b1: float) -> bool:
  return 0 <= b <= 80

# It is infrequent for a vehicle to have param B2's value lower than 50 or greater than 300 in a day.
def r3(b2: float) -> bool:
  return 50 <= c <= 300
