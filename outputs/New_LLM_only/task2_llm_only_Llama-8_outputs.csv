Let's evaluate the premises:

1. For trips of at least 20 km, the minimum fuel consumption rate per 100 km is 40 dm³/100 km.
Since the distance is 133.05 km, which is greater than 20 km, we need to check if the fuel consumption rate per 100 km is at least 40 dm³/100 km. The total fuel consumption is 88.7 dm³, and the distance is 133.05 km, so the fuel consumption rate per 100 km is 88.7 / 1.3305 ≈ 66.7 dm³/100 km, which is less than 40 dm³/100 km. This condition is violated.

2. Stops with PTO engaged cannot outnumber the total stops.
The number of stops with PTO engaged is 25, and the total number of stops is 66. Since 25 is less than 66, this condition is not violated.

Since one condition is violated, the day is abnormal.

Used parameters: distance, total fuel consumption, total operation time, driving time.

";"

Let's evaluate the premises:

1. For trips of at least 20 km, the minimum fuel consumption rate per 100 km is 40 dm³/100 km.
Since the distance is 133.05 km, which is greater than 20 km, we need to check if the fuel consumption rate is at least 40 dm³/100 km. The total fuel consumption is 88.7 dm³, and the distance is 133.05 km, so the fuel consumption rate is 88.7 / 133.05 ≈ 0.666 dm³/100 km, which is less than 40 dm³/100 km. This condition is violated.

2. Driving time should be less than or equal to the total operation time.
The driving time is 1.5 h, and the total operation time is 5.1 h, so this condition is not violated.

Since one condition is violated, the day is abnormal. Therefore, the result is:

Let's evaluate the premises:

1. PTO operation time should be less than or equal to the total operation time.
	* Given: PTO operation time = 0.6 h, total operation time = 9.5 h
	* Condition is satisfied: 0.6 h <= 9.5 h
2. Total operation time must be greater than or equal to the sum of PTO operation, idle, and driving times.
	* Given: PTO operation time = 0.6 h, idle time = 1.9 h, driving time = 1.6 h
	* Sum of PTO operation, idle, and driving times = 0.6 h + 1.9 h + 1.6 h = 4.1 h
	* Given total operation time = 6.5 h, which is less than the sum of PTO operation, idle, and driving times

Since one condition is violated (the second premise), the day is abnormal.

Let's evaluate the premises:

1. The vehicle's average hourly fuel consumption cannot be less than 5 dm³/h, provided that it traveled at least 20 km.

To calculate the average hourly fuel consumption, we need to divide the total fuel consumption by the total operation time:

average hourly fuel consumption = total fuel consumption / total operation time
= 18.9 dm³ / 4.725 h
= 3.98 dm³/h

Since the vehicle traveled at least 20 km, this condition is not violated.

2. The vehicle's minimum average fuel consumption per 100 km, if it travels 20 km or more, is 40 dm³/100 km.

Since the vehicle traveled 88.8 km, which is more than 20 km, we need to calculate the average fuel consumption per 100 km:

average fuel consumption per 100 km = total fuel consumption / distance
= 44.4 dm³ / 88.8 km
= 50.0 dm³/100 km

This condition is not violated.

Since neither condition is violated, the day is not abnormal.

Let's evaluate the data points:

1. Driving time must always be less than or equal to the total operation time:
   Given driving time: 2.8 h, total operation time: 5.5 h. Since 2.8 h is less than 5.5 h, this condition is satisfied.
2. Total operation time must be greater than or equal to the sum of PTO operation, idle, and driving times:
   Given total operation time: 5.5 h, PTO operation time: 1.3 h, idle time: 2.5 h, driving time: 1.7 h.
   The sum of PTO operation, idle, and driving times is: 1.3 h + 2.5 h + 1.7 h = 5.5 h. This condition is satisfied.

Since both conditions are satisfied, the day is not abnormal. Therefore, the result is:

The condition is: The total operation duration must not be lower than the PTO operation time.

Data point: total operation time: 2.2 h, PTO operation time: 3.3 h

The total operation duration is lower than the PTO operation time, so the condition is violated.

The condition is: Axle 2's load must always be equal to or greater than the payload.

Data point: axle 2 load: 3884.6 kg, payload: 3884.6 kg

The axle 2 load is equal to the payload, so the condition is satisfied.

Let's evaluate the premises:

1. For a journey of at least 20 km, the vehicle's lowest average fuel consumption per hour is 5 dm³/h.
Since the total operation time is 4.725 h, the total distance traveled is unknown. However, we can calculate the average fuel consumption per hour as follows:
total fuel consumption / total operation time = 18.9 dm³ / 4.725 h ≈ 3.98 dm³/h
Since this value is less than 5 dm³/h, this condition is not violated.

2. Stops with PTO engaged cannot outnumber the total stops.
stops with PTO engaged = 118, total stops = 118
Since the number of stops with PTO engaged is equal to the total number of stops, this condition is not violated.

Since neither of the conditions is violated, the day is not abnormal. Therefore, the result is:

2. The payload must always be smaller than or equal to the load on axle 2.

4. Axle 2 load: 8753.7 kg

Let's evaluate the premises:

1. Driving time should be less than or equal to the total operation time.
   1.5 h (driving time) is less than or equal to 5.1 h (total operation time). True.

2. The payload must always be smaller than or equal to the load on axle 2.
   966.7 kg (payload) is less than 8753.7 kg (axle 2 load). True.

Since both conditions are met, the day is not abnormal. Therefore, the result is:

Let's evaluate the premises:

1. If the distance covered by the vehicle is at least 20 km, the minimum average fuel consumption rate per hour is 5 dm³/h.
Since the total operation time is 5.1 h, the total distance covered is not given. However, we can calculate it as total distance = total operation time * average speed. Since the average speed is not given, we cannot determine if the distance covered is at least 20 km.

2. Driving time must always be less than or equal to the total operation time.
Given data: driving time = 1.5 h, total operation time = 4.725 h. Since 1.5 h is less than 4.725 h, this condition is satisfied.

Since one condition is not satisfied (distance covered is not given), the day is abnormal.

3. Payload must remain below or equal to the load carried by axle 3.

Let's evaluate the data points:

1. The total operation time (9.5 h) is less than the idle time (5.3 h), which violates the first condition.
2. The number of stops where PTO is engaged (25) is less than the overall stop count (66), which is satisfied.
3. The payload (5897.2 kg) is equal to the load carried by axle 3 (5897.2 kg), which is satisfied.

Since one condition is violated, the day is abnormal.

Let's evaluate the premises:

1. If the vehicle covers a distance of no less than 20 km, its hourly fuel consumption cannot drop below 5 dm³/h.
	* Distance: 133.05 km (greater than 20 km), so this condition is satisfied.
	* Total fuel consumption: 88.7 dm³ (not hourly, but we can calculate the hourly fuel consumption as 88.7 dm³ / 4.725 h = 18.7 dm³/h, which is greater than 5 dm³/h, so this condition is satisfied.
2. For trips of at least 20 km, the minimum fuel consumption rate per 100 km is 40 dm³/100 km.
	* Distance: 133.05 km (greater than 20 km), so this condition applies.
	* Total fuel consumption: 88.7 dm³, and distance: 133.05 km, so the fuel consumption rate per 100 km is 88.7 dm³ / 133.05 km = 0.666 dm³/100 km, which is less than 40 dm³/100 km, so this condition is violated.
3. The payload cannot exceed the capacity of axle 3.
	* Payload: 8184.2 kg, Axle 3 load: 6597.0 kg, so the payload is greater than the capacity of axle 3, so this condition is violated.

Since at least one condition is violated (condition 2 and 3), the day is abnormal.

The given premises are:

1. The vehicle's average hourly fuel consumption cannot be less than 5 dm³/h, provided that it traveled at least 20 km.
2. Stops with PTO engaged cannot outnumber the total stops.
3. Axle 2's load must always be equal to or greater than the payload.

Let's evaluate these premises with the given data points:

1. The vehicle's average hourly fuel consumption cannot be less than 5 dm³/h, provided that it traveled at least 20 km.
The total operation time is 6.64 hours, and the total fuel consumption is 66.4 dm³. The average hourly fuel consumption is 66.4 / 6.64 ≈ 10.02 dm³/h, which is greater than 5 dm³/h. This condition is satisfied.

2. Stops with PTO engaged cannot outnumber the total stops.
The total stops are 66, and the stops with PTO engaged are 25. Since 25 is less than 66, this condition is satisfied.

3. Axle 2's load must always be equal to or greater than the payload.
The payload is 10268.5 kg, and the axle 2 load is 8400.7 kg. Since 8400.7 is less than 10268.5, this condition is not satisfied.

Since one condition is violated, the day is abnormal. Therefore, the result is:

";"

Let's evaluate the premises:

1. When the vehicle travels 20 km or more, the average fuel consumption per distance is at least 40 dm³/100 km.
Since the distance is 88.8 km, which is more than 20 km, the condition is: 40 dm³/100 km ≤ average fuel consumption per distance
The average fuel consumption per distance is 44.4 dm³ / 88.8 km = 50.0 dm³/100 km, which satisfies the condition.

2. Idle time cannot be greater than the total operation time.
Idle time is 2.0 h, and total operation time is 1.4 h. Since 2.0 h > 1.4 h, this condition is violated.

Since one condition is violated, the day is abnormal.

Since this premise is not related to the given data points, we can't evaluate it.

2. Idle time cannot be greater than the total operation time.
Idle time: 6.9 h, total operation time: 40.6 h. Since idle time is not greater than total operation time, this condition is satisfied.

3. PTO-engaged stops cannot exceed the total number of stops.

";"

Let's evaluate the premises:

1. The vehicle's minimum average fuel consumption per 100 km, if it travels 20 km or more, is 40 dm³/100 km.
Since the distance is 133.05 km, which is more than 20 km, we need to check if the average fuel consumption is at least 40 dm³/100 km. The total fuel consumption is 88.7 dm³, and the distance is 133.05 km, so the average fuel consumption is 88.7 / 133.05 ≈ 0.666 dm³/100 km, which is less than 40 dm³/100 km. This condition is violated.

2. PTO operation time must be less than or equal to the total operation time.
The PTO operation time is 1.9 h, and the total operation time is 9.5 h, so this condition is satisfied.

3. The payload must not exceed the load carried by axle 3.
The payload is 5897.2 kg, and the load carried by axle 3 is also 5897.2 kg, so this condition is satisfied.

Since one condition is violated (the fuel consumption condition), the day is abnormal.

Let's evaluate the premises:

1. The minimum average fuel consumption per distance, given that the vehicle has traveled at least 20 km, is 40 dm³/100 km.

We need to calculate the average fuel consumption per distance. Given distance = 133.05 km, total fuel consumption = 88.7 dm³, we get:

Average fuel consumption per distance = Total fuel consumption / Distance = 88.7 / 133.05 ≈ 0.666 dm³/100 km

Since this value is less than 40 dm³/100 km, this condition is violated.

2. The total operation duration must not be lower than the driving time.

Given total operation time = 5.6 h and driving time = 5.6 h, this condition is satisfied.

3. Payload must remain below or equal to the load carried by axle 2.

Given payload = 10268.5 kg and axle 2 load = 8400.7 kg, this condition is violated.

Since at least one condition is violated (conditions 1 and 3), the day is abnormal.

3. The load on axle 1 must not surpass the load on axle 3.

The data points are:

1. total operation time: 5.1 h
2. driving time: 1.5 h
3. stops: 85
4. stops with PTO engaged: 99
5. axle 1 load: 7203.1 kg
6. axle 3 load: 6652.3 kg

Let's evaluate the premises:

1. Driving time must always be less than or equal to the total operation time.
   driving time (1.5 h) is less than or equal to total operation time (5.1 h), so this condition is satisfied.

2. The number of stops where PTO is engaged must not exceed the overall stop count.
   stops with PTO engaged (99) exceeds overall stop count (85), so this condition is violated.

3. The load on axle 1 must not surpass the load on axle 3.
   axle 1 load (7203.1 kg) is greater than axle 3 load (6652.3 kg), so this condition is satisfied.

Since one condition is violated (the number of stops where PTO is engaged exceeds the overall stop count), the day is abnormal.

The total operation time is 40.6 h, which is greater than the idle time (5.3 h), so this condition is not violated.

3. Driving time should be less than or equal to the total operation time.
The driving time is 5.6 h, which is less than or equal to the total operation time (40.6 h), so this condition is not violated.

Let's evaluate the premises:

1. If the vehicle covers at least 20 km, the average fuel consumption per distance cannot be lower than 40 dm³/100 km.
	* distance: 88.8 km, total fuel consumption: 44.4 dm³
	* Average fuel consumption per distance = total fuel consumption / distance = 44.4 / 88.8 ≈ 0.5 dm³/100 km
	* Since 0.5 dm³/100 km is lower than 40 dm³/100 km, this condition is violated.
2. Driving time should be less than or equal to the total operation time.
	* driving time: 2.8 h, total operation time: 8.0 h
	* Since 2.8 h is less than 8.0 h, this condition is satisfied.
3. Stops with PTO engaged should never outnumber total stops.
	* stops with PTO engaged: 118, total stops: 118
	* Since the number of stops with PTO engaged is equal to the total number of stops, this condition is satisfied.
4. The payload must not exceed the load carried by axle 3.
	* payload: 2785.0 kg, axle 3 load: 5327.8 kg
	* Since 2785.0 kg is less than 5327.8 kg, this condition is satisfied.
5. Total operation time must be greater than or equal to the sum of PTO operation, idle, and driving times.
	* total operation time: 8.0 h, PTO operation time: 4.6 h, idle time: 2.2 h, driving time: 1.6 h
	* Sum of PTO operation, idle, and driving times = 4.6 + 2.2 + 1.6 = 8.4 h
	* Since 8.0 h is less than 8.4 h, this condition is violated.

Since at least one condition is violated (premise 1 and premise 5), the day is abnormal.
