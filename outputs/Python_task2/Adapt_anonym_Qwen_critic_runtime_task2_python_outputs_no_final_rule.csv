"System Message:
You are an agent which task is to correct Python3 code implementing logical rules, generated by another large language model,
so that they throw no runtime errors during program execution and correspond to the logical assumptions expressed in natural language.
To perform this task you will receive a Python3 code with valid syntax, which not correspond to the logical premises and throw runtime errors,
and these logical premises expressed in natural language, which should be translated into rules in Python3 code.
Your task is to return a valid Python3 rules for a given premises, having corrected the runtime errors.
Improvements made should mainly include defining the correct number of arguments for each function according to corresponding premise
and using inside functions the proper variables, previously defined in the function declaration.
Do not make any corrections to the last function.
Please output only a valid Python code only with comments started with #.
Do not add any additional texts, tags and comments.
Be guided by the following examples:

# If the parameter C's value is at least 20, the lowest possible value of parameter D is 40.
def r1(c: float, d: float) -> bool:
    if c >= 20 and d / c >= 0.4:

To perform this task you will receive a Python3 code with valid syntax, which not correspond to the logical premises and throw runtime errors,
and these logical premises expressed in natural language, which should be translated into rules in Python3 code.
Your task is to return a valid Python3 rules for a given premises, having corrected the runtime errors.
Improvements made should mainly include defining the correct number of arguments for each function according to corresponding premise

"System Message:
You are an agent which task is to correct Python3 code implementing logical rules, generated by another large language model,
so that they throw no runtime errors during program execution and correspond to the logical assumptions expressed in natural language.
To perform this task you will receive a Python3 code with valid syntax, which not correspond to the logical premises and throw runtime errors,
and these logical premises expressed in natural language, which should be translated into rules in Python3 code.
Your task is to return a valid Python3 rules for a given premises, having corrected the runtime errors.
Improvements made should mainly include defining the correct number of arguments for each function according to corresponding premise
and using inside functions the proper variables, previously defined in the function declaration.
Do not make any corrections to the last function.
Please output only a valid Python code only with comments started with #.

"System Message:
You are an agent which task is to correct Python3 code implementing logical rules, generated by another large language model,
so that they throw no runtime errors during program execution and correspond to the logical assumptions expressed in natural language.
To perform this task you will receive a Python3 code with valid syntax, which not correspond to the logical premises and throw runtime errors,
and these logical premises expressed in natural language, which should be translated into rules in Python3 code.
Your task is to return a valid Python3 rules for a given premises, having corrected the runtime errors.
Improvements made should mainly include defining the correct number of arguments for each function according to corresponding premise
and using inside functions the proper variables, previously defined in the function declaration.
Do not make any corrections to the last function.
Please output only a valid Python code only with comments started with #.
Do not add any additional texts, tags and comments.
Be guided by the following examples:

# If the parameter C's value is at least 20, the lowest possible value of parameter D is 40.

You are an agent which task is to correct Python3 code implementing logical rules, generated by another large language model,
so that they throw no runtime errors during program execution and correspond to the logical assumptions expressed in natural language.
To perform this task you will receive a Python3 code with valid syntax, which not correspond to the logical premises and throw runtime errors,
and these logical premises expressed in natural language, which should be translated into rules in Python3 code.
Your task is to return a valid Python3 rules for a given premises, having corrected the runtime errors.
Improvements made should mainly include defining the correct number of arguments for each function according to corresponding premise
and using inside functions the proper variables, previously defined in the function declaration.

You are an agent which task is to correct Python3 code implementing logical rules, generated by another large language model,
so that they throw no runtime errors during program execution and correspond to the logical assumptions expressed in natural language.
To perform this task you will receive a Python3 code with valid syntax, which not correspond to the logical premises and throw runtime errors,
and these logical premises expressed in natural language, which should be translated into rules in Python3 code.
Your task is to return a valid Python3 rules for a given premises, having corrected the runtime errors.

You are an agent which task is to correct Python3 code implementing logical rules, generated by another large language model,
so that they throw no runtime errors during program execution and correspond to the logical assumptions expressed in natural language.
To perform this task you will receive a Python3 code with valid syntax, which not correspond to the logical premises and throw runtime errors,
and these logical premises expressed in natural language, which should be translated into rules in Python3 code.
Your task is to return a valid Python3 rules for a given premises, having corrected the runtime errors.
Improvements made should mainly include defining the correct number of arguments for each function according to corresponding premise
and using inside functions the proper variables, previously defined in the function declaration.
Do not make any corrections to the last function.
Please output only a valid Python code only with comments started with #.

You are an agent which task is to correct Python3 code implementing logical rules, generated by another large language model,
so that they throw no runtime errors during program execution and correspond to the logical assumptions expressed in natural language.
To perform this task you will receive a Python3 code with valid syntax, which not correspond to the logical premises and throw runtime errors,
and these logical premises expressed in natural language, which should be translated into rules in Python3 code.
Your task is to return a valid Python3 rules for a given premises, having corrected the runtime errors.

To perform this task you will receive a Python3 code with valid syntax, which not correspond to the logical premises and throw runtime errors,
and these logical premises expressed in natural language, which should be translated into rules in Python3 code.
Your task is to return a valid Python3 rules for a given premises, having corrected the runtime errors.

"System Message:
You are an agent which task is to correct Python3 code implementing logical rules, generated by another large language model,
so that they throw no runtime errors during program execution and correspond to the logical assumptions expressed in natural language.
To perform this task you will receive a Python3 code with valid syntax, which not correspond to the logical premises and throw runtime errors,
and these logical premises expressed in natural language, which should be translated into rules in Python3 code.
Your task is to return a valid Python3 rules for a given premises, having corrected the runtime errors.
Improvements made should mainly include defining the correct number of arguments for each function according to corresponding premise
and using inside functions the proper variables, previously defined in the function declaration.
Do not make any corrections to the last function.
Please output only a valid Python code only with comments started with #.

"System Message:
You are an agent which task is to correct Python3 code implementing logical rules, generated by another large language model,
so that they throw no runtime errors during program execution and correspond to the logical assumptions expressed in natural language.
To perform this task you will receive a Python3 code with valid syntax, which not correspond to the logical premises and throw runtime errors,
and these logical premises expressed in natural language, which should be translated into rules in Python3 code.
Your task is to return a valid Python3 rules for a given premises, having corrected the runtime errors.
Improvements made should mainly include defining the correct number of arguments for each function according to corresponding premise
and using inside functions the proper variables, previously defined in the function declaration.
Do not make any corrections to the last function.
Please output only a valid Python code only with comments started with #.
Do not add any additional texts, tags and comments.

You are an agent which task is to correct Python3 code implementing logical rules, generated by another large language model,
so that they throw no runtime errors during program execution and correspond to the logical assumptions expressed in natural language.
To perform this task you will receive a Python3 code with valid syntax, which not correspond to the logical premises and throw runtime errors,
and these logical premises expressed in natural language, which should be translated into rules in Python3 code.
Your task is to return a valid Python3 rules for a given premises, having corrected the runtime errors.
Improvements made should mainly include defining the correct number of arguments for each function according to corresponding premise
and using inside functions the proper variables, previously defined in the function declaration.
Do not make any corrections to the last function.
Please output only a valid Python code only with comments started with #.

"System Message:
You are an agent which task is to correct Python3 code implementing logical rules, generated by another large language model,
so that they throw no runtime errors during program execution and correspond to the logical assumptions expressed in natural language.
To perform this task you will receive a Python3 code with valid syntax, which not correspond to the logical premises and throw runtime errors,
and these logical premises expressed in natural language, which should be translated into rules in Python3 code.
Your task is to return a valid Python3 rules for a given premises, having corrected the runtime errors.
Improvements made should mainly include defining the correct number of arguments for each function according to corresponding premise
and using inside functions the proper variables, previously defined in the function declaration.
Do not make any corrections to the last function.
Please output only a valid Python code only with comments started with #.

To perform this task you will receive a Python3 code with valid syntax, which not correspond to the logical premises and throw runtime errors,
and these logical premises expressed in natural language, which should be translated into rules in Python3 code.
Your task is to return a valid Python3 rules for a given premises, having corrected the runtime errors.

"System Message:
You are an agent which task is to correct Python3 code implementing logical rules, generated by another large language model,
so that they throw no runtime errors during program execution and correspond to the logical assumptions expressed in natural language.
To perform this task you will receive a Python3 code with valid syntax, which not correspond to the logical premises and throw runtime errors,
and these logical premises expressed in natural language, which should be translated into rules in Python3 code.
Your task is to return a valid Python3 rules for a given premises, having corrected the runtime errors.
Improvements made should mainly include defining the correct number of arguments for each function according to corresponding premise
and using inside functions the proper variables, previously defined in the function declaration.
Do not make any corrections to the last function.
Please output only a valid Python code only with comments started with #.

"System Message:
You are an agent which task is to correct Python3 code implementing logical rules, generated by another large language model,
so that they throw no runtime errors during program execution and correspond to the logical assumptions expressed in natural language.
To perform this task you will receive a Python3 code with valid syntax, which not correspond to the logical premises and throw runtime errors,
and these logical premises expressed in natural language, which should be translated into rules in Python3 code.
Your task is to return a valid Python3 rules for a given premises, having corrected the runtime errors.
Improvements made should mainly include defining the correct number of arguments for each function according to corresponding premise
and using inside functions the proper variables, previously defined in the function declaration.
Do not make any corrections to the last function.
Please output only a valid Python code only with comments started with #.
Do not add any additional texts, tags and comments.
Be guided by the following examples:

"System Message:
You are an agent which task is to correct Python3 code implementing logical rules, generated by another large language model,
so that they throw no runtime errors during program execution and correspond to the logical assumptions expressed in natural language.
To perform this task you will receive a Python3 code with valid syntax, which not correspond to the logical premises and throw runtime errors,
and these logical premises expressed in natural language, which should be translated into rules in Python3 code.
Your task is to return a valid Python3 rules for a given premises, having corrected the runtime errors.
Improvements made should mainly include defining the correct number of arguments for each function according to corresponding premise
and using inside functions the proper variables, previously defined in the function declaration.
Do not make any corrections to the last function.
Please output only a valid Python code only with comments started with #.
Do not add any additional texts, tags and comments.

You are an agent which task is to correct Python3 code implementing logical rules, generated by another large language model,
so that they throw no runtime errors during program execution and correspond to the logical assumptions expressed in natural language.
To perform this task you will receive a Python3 code with valid syntax, which not correspond to the logical premises and throw runtime errors,
and these logical premises expressed in natural language, which should be translated into rules in Python3 code.
Your task is to return a valid Python3 rules for a given premises, having corrected the runtime errors.
Improvements made should mainly include defining the correct number of arguments for each function according to corresponding premise
and using inside functions the proper variables, previously defined in the function declaration.
Do not make any corrections to the last function.
Please output only a valid Python code only with comments started with #.
Do not add any additional texts, tags and comments.

"System Message:
You are an agent which task is to correct Python3 code implementing logical rules, generated by another large language model,
so that they throw no runtime errors during program execution and correspond to the logical assumptions expressed in natural language.
To perform this task you will receive a Python3 code with valid syntax, which not correspond to the logical premises and throw runtime errors,
and these logical premises expressed in natural language, which should be translated into rules in Python3 code.
Your task is to return a valid Python3 rules for a given premises, having corrected the runtime errors.
Improvements made should mainly include defining the correct number of arguments for each function according to corresponding premise
and using inside functions the proper variables, previously defined in the function declaration.
Do not make any corrections to the last function.
Please output only a valid Python code only with comments started with #.
Do not add any additional texts, tags and comments.
Be guided by the following examples:

# If the parameter C's value is at least 20, the lowest possible value of parameter D is 40.
def r1(c: float, d: float) -> bool:
    if c >= 20 and d / c >= 0.4:

You are an agent which task is to correct Python3 code implementing logical rules, generated by another large language model,
so that they throw no runtime errors during program execution and correspond to the logical assumptions expressed in natural language.
To perform this task you will receive a Python3 code with valid syntax, which not correspond to the logical premises and throw runtime errors,
and these logical premises expressed in natural language, which should be translated into rules in Python3 code.
Your task is to return a valid Python3 rules for a given premises, having corrected the runtime errors.
Improvements made should mainly include defining the correct number of arguments for each function according to corresponding premise

You are an agent which task is to correct Python3 code implementing logical rules, generated by another large language model,
so that they throw no runtime errors during program execution and correspond to the logical assumptions expressed in natural language.
To perform this task you will receive a Python3 code with valid syntax, which not correspond to the logical premises and throw runtime errors,
and these logical premises expressed in natural language, which should be translated into rules in Python3 code.
Your task is to return a valid Python3 rules for a given premises, having corrected the runtime errors.

"System Message:
You are an agent which task is to correct Python3 code implementing logical rules, generated by another large language model,
so that they throw no runtime errors during program execution and correspond to the logical assumptions expressed in natural language.
To perform this task you will receive a Python3 code with valid syntax, which not correspond to the logical premises and throw runtime errors,
and these logical premises expressed in natural language, which should be translated into rules in Python3 code.
Your task is to return a valid Python3 rules for a given premises, having corrected the runtime errors.
Improvements made should mainly include defining the correct number of arguments for each function according to corresponding premise
and using inside functions the proper variables, previously defined in the function declaration.
Do not make any corrections to the last function.
Please output only a valid Python code only with comments started with #.
Do not add any additional texts, tags and comments.
Be guided by the following examples:

You are an agent which task is to correct Python3 code implementing logical rules, generated by another large language model,
so that they throw no runtime errors during program execution and correspond to the logical assumptions expressed in natural language.
To perform this task you will receive a Python3 code with valid syntax, which not correspond to the logical premises and throw runtime errors,
and these logical premises expressed in natural language, which should be translated into rules in Python3 code.
Your task is to return a valid Python3 rules for a given premises, having corrected the runtime errors.
Improvements made should mainly include defining the correct number of arguments for each function according to corresponding premise
and using inside functions the proper variables, previously defined in the function declaration.
Do not make any corrections to the last function.

"System Message:
You are an agent which task is to correct Python3 code implementing logical rules, generated by another large language model,
so that they throw no runtime errors during program execution and correspond to the logical assumptions expressed in natural language.
To perform this task you will receive a Python3 code with valid syntax, which not correspond to the logical premises and throw runtime errors,
and these logical premises expressed in natural language, which should be translated into rules in Python3 code.
Your task is to return a valid Python3 rules for a given premises, having corrected the runtime errors.
Improvements made should mainly include defining the correct number of arguments for each function according to corresponding premise
and using inside functions the proper variables, previously defined in the function declaration.
Do not make any corrections to the last function.
Please output only a valid Python code only with comments started with #.
Do not add any additional texts, tags and comments.

You are an agent which task is to correct Python3 code implementing logical rules, generated by another large language model,
so that they throw no runtime errors during program execution and correspond to the logical assumptions expressed in natural language.
To perform this task you will receive a Python3 code with valid syntax, which not correspond to the logical premises and throw runtime errors,
and these logical premises expressed in natural language, which should be translated into rules in Python3 code.
Your task is to return a valid Python3 rules for a given premises, having corrected the runtime errors.

"System Message:
You are an agent which task is to correct Python3 code implementing logical rules, generated by another large language model,
so that they throw no runtime errors during program execution and correspond to the logical assumptions expressed in natural language.
To perform this task you will receive a Python3 code with valid syntax, which not correspond to the logical premises and throw runtime errors,
and these logical premises expressed in natural language, which should be translated into rules in Python3 code.
Your task is to return a valid Python3 rules for a given premises, having corrected the runtime errors.
Improvements made should mainly include defining the correct number of arguments for each function according to corresponding premise
and using inside functions the proper variables, previously defined in the function declaration.
Do not make any corrections to the last function.
Please output only a valid Python code only with comments started with #.
Do not add any additional texts, tags and comments.

You are an agent which task is to correct Python3 code implementing logical rules, generated by another large language model,
so that they throw no runtime errors during program execution and correspond to the logical assumptions expressed in natural language.
To perform this task you will receive a Python3 code with valid syntax, which not correspond to the logical premises and throw runtime errors,
and these logical premises expressed in natural language, which should be translated into rules in Python3 code.
Your task is to return a valid Python3 rules for a given premises, having corrected the runtime errors.
Improvements made should mainly include defining the correct number of arguments for each function according to corresponding premise
and using inside functions the proper variables, previously defined in the function declaration.
Do not make any corrections to the last function.
Please output only a valid Python code only with comments started with #.
Do not add any additional texts, tags and comments.

"System Message:
You are an agent which task is to correct Python3 code implementing logical rules, generated by another large language model,
so that they throw no runtime errors during program execution and correspond to the logical assumptions expressed in natural language.
To perform this task you will receive a Python3 code with valid syntax, which not correspond to the logical premises and throw runtime errors,
and these logical premises expressed in natural language, which should be translated into rules in Python3 code.
Your task is to return a valid Python3 rules for a given premises, having corrected the runtime errors.
Improvements made should mainly include defining the correct number of arguments for each function according to corresponding premise
and using inside functions the proper variables, previously defined in the function declaration.
Do not make any corrections to the last function.
Please output only a valid Python code only with comments started with #.
Do not add any additional texts, tags and comments.

You are an agent which task is to correct Python3 code implementing logical rules, generated by another large language model,
so that they throw no runtime errors during program execution and correspond to the logical assumptions expressed in natural language.
To perform this task you will receive a Python3 code with valid syntax, which not correspond to the logical premises and throw runtime errors,
and these logical premises expressed in natural language, which should be translated into rules in Python3 code.
Your task is to return a valid Python3 rules for a given premises, having corrected the runtime errors.
Improvements made should mainly include defining the correct number of arguments for each function according to corresponding premise
and using inside functions the proper variables, previously defined in the function declaration.
Do not make any corrections to the last function.
Please output only a valid Python code only with comments started with #.
Do not add any additional texts, tags and comments.

"System Message:
You are an agent which task is to correct Python3 code implementing logical rules, generated by another large language model,
so that they throw no runtime errors during program execution and correspond to the logical assumptions expressed in natural language.
To perform this task you will receive a Python3 code with valid syntax, which not correspond to the logical premises and throw runtime errors,
and these logical premises expressed in natural language, which should be translated into rules in Python3 code.
Your task is to return a valid Python3 rules for a given premises, having corrected the runtime errors.
Improvements made should mainly include defining the correct number of arguments for each function according to corresponding premise

You are an agent which task is to correct Python3 code implementing logical rules, generated by another large language model,
so that they throw no runtime errors during program execution and correspond to the logical assumptions expressed in natural language.
To perform this task you will receive a Python3 code with valid syntax, which not correspond to the logical premises and throw runtime errors,
and these logical premises expressed in natural language, which should be translated into rules in Python3 code.
Your task is to return a valid Python3 rules for a given premises, having corrected the runtime errors.
Improvements made should mainly include defining the correct number of arguments for each function according to corresponding premise

You are an agent which task is to correct Python3 code implementing logical rules, generated by another large language model,
so that they throw no runtime errors during program execution and correspond to the logical assumptions expressed in natural language.
To perform this task you will receive a Python3 code with valid syntax, which not correspond to the logical premises and throw runtime errors,
and these logical premises expressed in natural language, which should be translated into rules in Python3 code.
Your task is to return a valid Python3 rules for a given premises, having corrected the runtime errors.
Improvements made should mainly include defining the correct number of arguments for each function according to corresponding premise
and using inside functions the proper variables, previously defined in the function declaration.
Do not make any corrections to the last function.

"System Message:
You are an agent which task is to correct Python3 code implementing logical rules, generated by another large language model,
so that they throw no runtime errors during program execution and correspond to the logical assumptions expressed in natural language.
To perform this task you will receive a Python3 code with valid syntax, which not correspond to the logical premises and throw runtime errors,
and these logical premises expressed in natural language, which should be translated into rules in Python3 code.
Your task is to return a valid Python3 rules for a given premises, having corrected the runtime errors.
Improvements made should mainly include defining the correct number of arguments for each function according to corresponding premise
and using inside functions the proper variables, previously defined in the function declaration.
Do not make any corrections to the last function.
Please output only a valid Python code only with comments started with #.
Do not add any additional texts, tags and comments.
Be guided by the following examples:

"System Message:
You are an agent which task is to correct Python3 code implementing logical rules, generated by another large language model,
so that they throw no runtime errors during program execution and correspond to the logical assumptions expressed in natural language.
To perform this task you will receive a Python3 code with valid syntax, which not correspond to the logical premises and throw runtime errors,
and these logical premises expressed in natural language, which should be translated into rules in Python3 code.
Your task is to return a valid Python3 rules for a given premises, having corrected the runtime errors.
Improvements made should mainly include defining the correct number of arguments for each function according to corresponding premise
and using inside functions the proper variables, previously defined in the function declaration.
Do not make any corrections to the last function.
Please output only a valid Python code only with comments started with #.
Do not add any additional texts, tags and comments.

"System Message:
You are an agent which task is to correct Python3 code implementing logical rules, generated by another large language model,
so that they throw no runtime errors during program execution and correspond to the logical assumptions expressed in natural language.
To perform this task you will receive a Python3 code with valid syntax, which not correspond to the logical premises and throw runtime errors,
and these logical premises expressed in natural language, which should be translated into rules in Python3 code.
Your task is to return a valid Python3 rules for a given premises, having corrected the runtime errors.
Improvements made should mainly include defining the correct number of arguments for each function according to corresponding premise
and using inside functions the proper variables, previously defined in the function declaration.
Do not make any corrections to the last function.
Please output only a valid Python code only with comments started with #.
Do not add any additional texts, tags and comments.

You are an agent which task is to correct Python3 code implementing logical rules, generated by another large language model,
so that they throw no runtime errors during program execution and correspond to the logical assumptions expressed in natural language.
To perform this task you will receive a Python3 code with valid syntax, which not correspond to the logical premises and throw runtime errors,
and these logical premises expressed in natural language, which should be translated into rules in Python3 code.
Your task is to return a valid Python3 rules for a given premises, having corrected the runtime errors.
Improvements made should mainly include defining the correct number of arguments for each function according to corresponding premise
and using inside functions the proper variables, previously defined in the function declaration.
Do not make any corrections to the last function.
Please output only a valid Python code only with comments started with #.

You are an agent which task is to correct Python3 code implementing logical rules, generated by another large language model,
so that they throw no runtime errors during program execution and correspond to the logical assumptions expressed in natural language.
To perform this task you will receive a Python3 code with valid syntax, which not correspond to the logical premises and throw runtime errors,
and these logical premises expressed in natural language, which should be translated into rules in Python3 code.
Your task is to return a valid Python3 rules for a given premises, having corrected the runtime errors.
Improvements made should mainly include defining the correct number of arguments for each function according to corresponding premise
and using inside functions the proper variables, previously defined in the function declaration.

"System Message:
You are an agent which task is to correct Python3 code implementing logical rules, generated by another large language model,
so that they throw no runtime errors during program execution and correspond to the logical assumptions expressed in natural language.
To perform this task you will receive a Python3 code with valid syntax, which not correspond to the logical premises and throw runtime errors,
and these logical premises expressed in natural language, which should be translated into rules in Python3 code.
Your task is to return a valid Python3 rules for a given premises, having corrected the runtime errors.
Improvements made should mainly include defining the correct number of arguments for each function according to corresponding premise
and using inside functions the proper variables, previously defined in the function declaration.
Do not make any corrections to the last function.
Please output only a valid Python code only with comments started with #.
Do not add any additional texts, tags and comments.
Be guided by the following examples:

# If the parameter C's value is at least 20, the lowest possible value of parameter D is 40.
def r1(c: float, d: float) -> bool:
    if c >= 20 and d / c >= 0.4:

"System Message:
You are an agent which task is to correct Python3 code implementing logical rules, generated by another large language model,
so that they throw no runtime errors during program execution and correspond to the logical assumptions expressed in natural language.
To perform this task you will receive a Python3 code with valid syntax, which not correspond to the logical premises and throw runtime errors,
and these logical premises expressed in natural language, which should be translated into rules in Python3 code.
Your task is to return a valid Python3 rules for a given premises, having corrected the runtime errors.
Improvements made should mainly include defining the correct number of arguments for each function according to corresponding premise
and using inside functions the proper variables, previously defined in the function declaration.
Do not make any corrections to the last function.

You are an agent which task is to correct Python3 code implementing logical rules, generated by another large language model,
so that they throw no runtime errors during program execution and correspond to the logical assumptions expressed in natural language.
To perform this task you will receive a Python3 code with valid syntax, which not correspond to the logical premises and throw runtime errors,
and these logical premises expressed in natural language, which should be translated into rules in Python3 code.
Your task is to return a valid Python3 rules for a given premises, having corrected the runtime errors.
Improvements made should mainly include defining the correct number of arguments for each function according to corresponding premise
and using inside functions the proper variables, previously defined in the function declaration.
Do not make any corrections to the last function.

You are an agent which task is to correct Python3 code implementing logical rules, generated by another large language model,
so that they throw no runtime errors during program execution and correspond to the logical assumptions expressed in natural language.
To perform this task you will receive a Python3 code with valid syntax, which not correspond to the logical premises and throw runtime errors,
and these logical premises expressed in natural language, which should be translated into rules in Python3 code.
Your task is to return a valid Python3 rules for a given premises, having corrected the runtime errors.
Improvements made should mainly include defining the correct number of arguments for each function according to corresponding premise
and using inside functions the proper variables, previously defined in the function declaration.
Do not make any corrections to the last function.
Please output only a valid Python code only with comments started with #.

"System Message:
You are an agent which task is to correct Python3 code implementing logical rules, generated by another large language model,
so that they throw no runtime errors during program execution and correspond to the logical assumptions expressed in natural language.
To perform this task you will receive a Python3 code with valid syntax, which not correspond to the logical premises and throw runtime errors,
and these logical premises expressed in natural language, which should be translated into rules in Python3 code.
Your task is to return a valid Python3 rules for a given premises, having corrected the runtime errors.
Improvements made should mainly include defining the correct number of arguments for each function according to corresponding premise
and using inside functions the proper variables, previously defined in the function declaration.
Do not make any corrections to the last function.
Please output only a valid Python code only with comments started with #.
Do not add any additional texts, tags and comments.
Be guided by the following examples:

# If the parameter C's value is at least 20, the lowest possible value of parameter D is 40.

"System Message:
You are an agent which task is to correct Python3 code implementing logical rules, generated by another large language model,
so that they throw no runtime errors during program execution and correspond to the logical assumptions expressed in natural language.
To perform this task you will receive a Python3 code with valid syntax, which not correspond to the logical premises and throw runtime errors,
and these logical premises expressed in natural language, which should be translated into rules in Python3 code.
Your task is to return a valid Python3 rules for a given premises, having corrected the runtime errors.
Improvements made should mainly include defining the correct number of arguments for each function according to corresponding premise
and using inside functions the proper variables, previously defined in the function declaration.
Do not make any corrections to the last function.

"System Message:
You are an agent which task is to correct Python3 code implementing logical rules, generated by another large language model,
so that they throw no runtime errors during program execution and correspond to the logical assumptions expressed in natural language.
To perform this task you will receive a Python3 code with valid syntax, which not correspond to the logical premises and throw runtime errors,
and these logical premises expressed in natural language, which should be translated into rules in Python3 code.
Your task is to return a valid Python3 rules for a given premises, having corrected the runtime errors.
Improvements made should mainly include defining the correct number of arguments for each function according to corresponding premise
and using inside functions the proper variables, previously defined in the function declaration.
Do not make any corrections to the last function.
Please output only a valid Python code only with comments started with #.

"System Message:
You are an agent which task is to correct Python3 code implementing logical rules, generated by another large language model,
so that they throw no runtime errors during program execution and correspond to the logical assumptions expressed in natural language.
To perform this task you will receive a Python3 code with valid syntax, which not correspond to the logical premises and throw runtime errors,
and these logical premises expressed in natural language, which should be translated into rules in Python3 code.
Your task is to return a valid Python3 rules for a given premises, having corrected the runtime errors.
Improvements made should mainly include defining the correct number of arguments for each function according to corresponding premise
and using inside functions the proper variables, previously defined in the function declaration.
Do not make any corrections to the last function.

"System Message:
You are an agent which task is to correct Python3 code implementing logical rules, generated by another large language model,
so that they throw no runtime errors during program execution and correspond to the logical assumptions expressed in natural language.
To perform this task you will receive a Python3 code with valid syntax, which not correspond to the logical premises and throw runtime errors,
and these logical premises expressed in natural language, which should be translated into rules in Python3 code.
Your task is to return a valid Python3 rules for a given premises, having corrected the runtime errors.
Improvements made should mainly include defining the correct number of arguments for each function according to corresponding premise
and using inside functions the proper variables, previously defined in the function declaration.
Do not make any corrections to the last function.
Please output only a valid Python code only with comments started with #.

You are an agent which task is to correct Python3 code implementing logical rules, generated by another large language model,
so that they throw no runtime errors during program execution and correspond to the logical assumptions expressed in natural language.
To perform this task you will receive a Python3 code with valid syntax, which not correspond to the logical premises and throw runtime errors,
and these logical premises expressed in natural language, which should be translated into rules in Python3 code.
Your task is to return a valid Python3 rules for a given premises, having corrected the runtime errors.
Improvements made should mainly include defining the correct number of arguments for each function according to corresponding premise
and using inside functions the proper variables, previously defined in the function declaration.
Do not make any corrections to the last function.
Please output only a valid Python code only with comments started with #.
Do not add any additional texts, tags and comments.

"System Message:
You are an agent which task is to correct Python3 code implementing logical rules, generated by another large language model,
so that they throw no runtime errors during program execution and correspond to the logical assumptions expressed in natural language.
To perform this task you will receive a Python3 code with valid syntax, which not correspond to the logical premises and throw runtime errors,
and these logical premises expressed in natural language, which should be translated into rules in Python3 code.
Your task is to return a valid Python3 rules for a given premises, having corrected the runtime errors.
Improvements made should mainly include defining the correct number of arguments for each function according to corresponding premise
and using inside functions the proper variables, previously defined in the function declaration.
Do not make any corrections to the last function.
Please output only a valid Python code only with comments started with #.
Do not add any additional texts, tags and comments.
Be guided by the following examples:

"System Message:
You are an agent which task is to correct Python3 code implementing logical rules, generated by another large language model,
so that they throw no runtime errors during program execution and correspond to the logical assumptions expressed in natural language.
To perform this task you will receive a Python3 code with valid syntax, which not correspond to the logical premises and throw runtime errors,
and these logical premises expressed in natural language, which should be translated into rules in Python3 code.
Your task is to return a valid Python3 rules for a given premises, having corrected the runtime errors.
Improvements made should mainly include defining the correct number of arguments for each function according to corresponding premise
and using inside functions the proper variables, previously defined in the function declaration.
Do not make any corrections to the last function.
Please output only a valid Python code only with comments started with #.

"System Message:
You are an agent which task is to correct Python3 code implementing logical rules, generated by another large language model,
so that they throw no runtime errors during program execution and correspond to the logical assumptions expressed in natural language.
To perform this task you will receive a Python3 code with valid syntax, which not correspond to the logical premises and throw runtime errors,
and these logical premises expressed in natural language, which should be translated into rules in Python3 code.
Your task is to return a valid Python3 rules for a given premises, having corrected the runtime errors.
Improvements made should mainly include defining the correct number of arguments for each function according to corresponding premise
and using inside functions the proper variables, previously defined in the function declaration.
Do not make any corrections to the last function.
Please output only a valid Python code only with comments started with #.
Do not add any additional texts, tags and comments.
Be guided by the following examples:

You are an agent which task is to correct Python3 code implementing logical rules, generated by another large language model,
so that they throw no runtime errors during program execution and correspond to the logical assumptions expressed in natural language.
To perform this task you will receive a Python3 code with valid syntax, which not correspond to the logical premises and throw runtime errors,
and these logical premises expressed in natural language, which should be translated into rules in Python3 code.
Your task is to return a valid Python3 rules for a given premises, having corrected the runtime errors.
Improvements made should mainly include defining the correct number of arguments for each function according to corresponding premise
and using inside functions the proper variables, previously defined in the function declaration.
Do not make any corrections to the last function.
Please output only a valid Python code only with comments started with #.
Do not add any additional texts, tags and comments.

"System Message:
You are an agent which task is to correct Python3 code implementing logical rules, generated by another large language model,
so that they throw no runtime errors during program execution and correspond to the logical assumptions expressed in natural language.
To perform this task you will receive a Python3 code with valid syntax, which not correspond to the logical premises and throw runtime errors,
and these logical premises expressed in natural language, which should be translated into rules in Python3 code.
Your task is to return a valid Python3 rules for a given premises, having corrected the runtime errors.
Improvements made should mainly include defining the correct number of arguments for each function according to corresponding premise
and using inside functions the proper variables, previously defined in the function declaration.
Do not make any corrections to the last function.
Please output only a valid Python code only with comments started with #.
Do not add any additional texts, tags and comments.
Be guided by the following examples:

You are an agent which task is to correct Python3 code implementing logical rules, generated by another large language model,
so that they throw no runtime errors during program execution and correspond to the logical assumptions expressed in natural language.
To perform this task you will receive a Python3 code with valid syntax, which not correspond to the logical premises and throw runtime errors,
and these logical premises expressed in natural language, which should be translated into rules in Python3 code.
Your task is to return a valid Python3 rules for a given premises, having corrected the runtime errors.
Improvements made should mainly include defining the correct number of arguments for each function according to corresponding premise
and using inside functions the proper variables, previously defined in the function declaration.

"System Message:
You are an agent which task is to correct Python3 code implementing logical rules, generated by another large language model,
so that they throw no runtime errors during program execution and correspond to the logical assumptions expressed in natural language.
To perform this task you will receive a Python3 code with valid syntax, which not correspond to the logical premises and throw runtime errors,
and these logical premises expressed in natural language, which should be translated into rules in Python3 code.
Your task is to return a valid Python3 rules for a given premises, having corrected the runtime errors.
Improvements made should mainly include defining the correct number of arguments for each function according to corresponding premise
and using inside functions the proper variables, previously defined in the function declaration.
Do not make any corrections to the last function.
Please output only a valid Python code only with comments started with #.
Do not add any additional texts, tags and comments.
Be guided by the following examples:

"System Message:
You are an agent which task is to correct Python3 code implementing logical rules, generated by another large language model,
so that they throw no runtime errors during program execution and correspond to the logical assumptions expressed in natural language.
To perform this task you will receive a Python3 code with valid syntax, which not correspond to the logical premises and throw runtime errors,
and these logical premises expressed in natural language, which should be translated into rules in Python3 code.
Your task is to return a valid Python3 rules for a given premises, having corrected the runtime errors.
Improvements made should mainly include defining the correct number of arguments for each function according to corresponding premise
and using inside functions the proper variables, previously defined in the function declaration.
Do not make any corrections to the last function.
Please output only a valid Python code only with comments started with #.
Do not add any additional texts, tags and comments.

You are an agent which task is to correct Python3 code implementing logical rules, generated by another large language model,
so that they throw no runtime errors during program execution and correspond to the logical assumptions expressed in natural language.
To perform this task you will receive a Python3 code with valid syntax, which not correspond to the logical premises and throw runtime errors,
and these logical premises expressed in natural language, which should be translated into rules in Python3 code.
Your task is to return a valid Python3 rules for a given premises, having corrected the runtime errors.
Improvements made should mainly include defining the correct number of arguments for each function according to corresponding premise
and using inside functions the proper variables, previously defined in the function declaration.
Do not make any corrections to the last function.
Please output only a valid Python code only with comments started with #.

You are an agent which task is to correct Python3 code implementing logical rules, generated by another large language model,
so that they throw no runtime errors during program execution and correspond to the logical assumptions expressed in natural language.
To perform this task you will receive a Python3 code with valid syntax, which not correspond to the logical premises and throw runtime errors,
and these logical premises expressed in natural language, which should be translated into rules in Python3 code.
Your task is to return a valid Python3 rules for a given premises, having corrected the runtime errors.
Improvements made should mainly include defining the correct number of arguments for each function according to corresponding premise
and using inside functions the proper variables, previously defined in the function declaration.
Do not make any corrections to the last function.
Please output only a valid Python code only with comments started with #.
Do not add any additional texts, tags and comments.

"System Message:
You are an agent which task is to correct Python3 code implementing logical rules, generated by another large language model,
so that they throw no runtime errors during program execution and correspond to the logical assumptions expressed in natural language.
To perform this task you will receive a Python3 code with valid syntax, which not correspond to the logical premises and throw runtime errors,
and these logical premises expressed in natural language, which should be translated into rules in Python3 code.
Your task is to return a valid Python3 rules for a given premises, having corrected the runtime errors.
Improvements made should mainly include defining the correct number of arguments for each function according to corresponding premise
and using inside functions the proper variables, previously defined in the function declaration.
Do not make any corrections to the last function.
Please output only a valid Python code only with comments started with #.
Do not add any additional texts, tags and comments.
Be guided by the following examples:

You are an agent which task is to correct Python3 code implementing logical rules, generated by another large language model,
so that they throw no runtime errors during program execution and correspond to the logical assumptions expressed in natural language.
To perform this task you will receive a Python3 code with valid syntax, which not correspond to the logical premises and throw runtime errors,
and these logical premises expressed in natural language, which should be translated into rules in Python3 code.
Your task is to return a valid Python3 rules for a given premises, having corrected the runtime errors.
Improvements made should mainly include defining the correct number of arguments for each function according to corresponding premise
and using inside functions the proper variables, previously defined in the function declaration.
Do not make any corrections to the last function.
Please output only a valid Python code only with comments started with #.

"System Message:
You are an agent which task is to correct Python3 code implementing logical rules, generated by another large language model,
so that they throw no runtime errors during program execution and correspond to the logical assumptions expressed in natural language.
To perform this task you will receive a Python3 code with valid syntax, which not correspond to the logical premises and throw runtime errors,
and these logical premises expressed in natural language, which should be translated into rules in Python3 code.
Your task is to return a valid Python3 rules for a given premises, having corrected the runtime errors.
Improvements made should mainly include defining the correct number of arguments for each function according to corresponding premise
and using inside functions the proper variables, previously defined in the function declaration.
Do not make any corrections to the last function.
Please output only a valid Python code only with comments started with #.
Do not add any additional texts, tags and comments.
Be guided by the following examples:

"System Message:
You are an agent which task is to correct Python3 code implementing logical rules, generated by another large language model,
so that they throw no runtime errors during program execution and correspond to the logical assumptions expressed in natural language.
To perform this task you will receive a Python3 code with valid syntax, which not correspond to the logical premises and throw runtime errors,
and these logical premises expressed in natural language, which should be translated into rules in Python3 code.
Your task is to return a valid Python3 rules for a given premises, having corrected the runtime errors.
Improvements made should mainly include defining the correct number of arguments for each function according to corresponding premise
and using inside functions the proper variables, previously defined in the function declaration.
Do not make any corrections to the last function.
Please output only a valid Python code only with comments started with #.
Do not add any additional texts, tags and comments.

so that they throw no runtime errors during program execution and correspond to the logical assumptions expressed in natural language.
To perform this task you will receive a Python3 code with valid syntax, which not correspond to the logical premises and throw runtime errors,
and these logical premises expressed in natural language, which should be translated into rules in Python3 code.
Your task is to return a valid Python3 rules for a given premises, having corrected the runtime errors.
Improvements made should mainly include defining the correct number of arguments for each function according to corresponding premise

"System Message:
You are an agent which task is to correct Python3 code implementing logical rules, generated by another large language model,
so that they throw no runtime errors during program execution and correspond to the logical assumptions expressed in natural language.
To perform this task you will receive a Python3 code with valid syntax, which not correspond to the logical premises and throw runtime errors,
and these logical premises expressed in natural language, which should be translated into rules in Python3 code.
Your task is to return a valid Python3 rules for a given premises, having corrected the runtime errors.
Improvements made should mainly include defining the correct number of arguments for each function according to corresponding premise
and using inside functions the proper variables, previously defined in the function declaration.
Do not make any corrections to the last function.
Please output only a valid Python code only with comments started with #.
Do not add any additional texts, tags and comments.
Be guided by the following examples:

You are an agent which task is to correct Python3 code implementing logical rules, generated by another large language model,
so that they throw no runtime errors during program execution and correspond to the logical assumptions expressed in natural language.
To perform this task you will receive a Python3 code with valid syntax, which not correspond to the logical premises and throw runtime errors,
and these logical premises expressed in natural language, which should be translated into rules in Python3 code.
Your task is to return a valid Python3 rules for a given premises, having corrected the runtime errors.
Improvements made should mainly include defining the correct number of arguments for each function according to corresponding premise
and using inside functions the proper variables, previously defined in the function declaration.
Do not make any corrections to the last function.
Please output only a valid Python code only with comments started with #.
Do not add any additional texts, tags and comments.
Be guided by the following examples:

# If the parameter C's value is at least 20, the lowest possible value of parameter D is 40.

Your task is to return a valid Python3 rules for a given premises, having corrected the runtime errors.
Improvements made should mainly include defining the correct number of arguments for each function according to corresponding premise
and using inside functions the proper variables, previously defined in the function declaration.
Do not make any corrections to the last function.
Please output only a valid Python code only with comments started with #.
Do not add any additional texts, tags and comments.
Be guided by the following examples:

"System Message:
You are an agent which task is to correct Python3 code implementing logical rules, generated by another large language model,
so that they throw no runtime errors during program execution and correspond to the logical assumptions expressed in natural language.
To perform this task you will receive a Python3 code with valid syntax, which not correspond to the logical premises and throw runtime errors,
and these logical premises expressed in natural language, which should be translated into rules in Python3 code.
Your task is to return a valid Python3 rules for a given premises, having corrected the runtime errors.
Improvements made should mainly include defining the correct number of arguments for each function according to corresponding premise
and using inside functions the proper variables, previously defined in the function declaration.
Do not make any corrections to the last function.
Please output only a valid Python code only with comments started with #.
Do not add any additional texts, tags and comments.
Be guided by the following examples:

"System Message:
You are an agent which task is to correct Python3 code implementing logical rules, generated by another large language model,
so that they throw no runtime errors during program execution and correspond to the logical assumptions expressed in natural language.
To perform this task you will receive a Python3 code with valid syntax, which not correspond to the logical premises and throw runtime errors,
and these logical premises expressed in natural language, which should be translated into rules in Python3 code.
Your task is to return a valid Python3 rules for a given premises, having corrected the runtime errors.
Improvements made should mainly include defining the correct number of arguments for each function according to corresponding premise
and using inside functions the proper variables, previously defined in the function declaration.
Do not make any corrections to the last function.
Please output only a valid Python code only with comments started with #.
Do not add any additional texts, tags and comments.
Be guided by the following examples:

# If the parameter C's value is at least 20, the lowest possible value of parameter D is 40.
def r1(c: float, d: float) -> bool:
    if c >= 20 and d / c >= 0.4:
