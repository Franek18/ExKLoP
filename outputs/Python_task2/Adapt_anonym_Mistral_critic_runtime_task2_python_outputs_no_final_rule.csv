"System Message:
You are an agent which task is to correct Python3 code implementing logical rules, generated by another large language model,
so that they throw no runtime errors during program execution and correspond to the logical assumptions expressed in natural language.
To perform this task you will receive a Python3 code with valid syntax, which not correspond to the logical premises and throw runtime errors,
and these logical premises expressed in natural language, which should be translated into rules in Python3 code.
Your task is to return a valid Python3 rules for a given premises, having corrected the runtime errors.
Improvements made should mainly include defining the correct number of arguments for each function according to corresponding premise
and using inside functions the proper variables, previously defined in the function declaration.
Do not make any corrections to the last function.
Please output only a valid Python code only with comments started with #.
Do not add any additional texts, tags and comments.

You are an agent which task is to correct Python3 code implementing logical rules, generated by another large language model,
so that they throw no runtime errors during program execution and correspond to the logical assumptions expressed in natural language.
To perform this task you will receive a Python3 code with valid syntax, which not correspond to the logical premises and throw runtime errors,
and these logical premises expressed in natural language, which should be translated into rules in Python3 code.
Your task is to return a valid Python3 rules for a given premises, having corrected the runtime errors.

You are an agent which task is to correct Python3 code implementing logical rules, generated by another large language model,
so that they throw no runtime errors during program execution and correspond to the logical assumptions expressed in natural language.
To perform this task you will receive a Python3 code with valid syntax, which not correspond to the logical premises and throw runtime errors,
and these logical premises expressed in natural language, which should be translated into rules in Python3 code.
Your task is to return a valid Python3 rules for a given premises, having corrected the runtime errors.
Improvements made should mainly include defining the correct number of arguments for each function according to corresponding premise

You are an agent which task is to correct Python3 code implementing logical rules, generated by another large language model,
so that they throw no runtime errors during program execution and correspond to the logical assumptions expressed in natural language.
To perform this task you will receive a Python3 code with valid syntax, which not correspond to the logical premises and throw runtime errors,
and these logical premises expressed in natural language, which should be translated into rules in Python3 code.
Your task is to return a valid Python3 rules for a given premises, having corrected the runtime errors.

"System Message:
You are an agent which task is to correct Python3 code implementing logical rules, generated by another large language model,
so that they throw no runtime errors during program execution and correspond to the logical assumptions expressed in natural language.
To perform this task you will receive a Python3 code with valid syntax, which not correspond to the logical premises and throw runtime errors,
and these logical premises expressed in natural language, which should be translated into rules in Python3 code.
Your task is to return a valid Python3 rules for a given premises, having corrected the runtime errors.
Improvements made should mainly include defining the correct number of arguments for each function according to corresponding premise
and using inside functions the proper variables, previously defined in the function declaration.
Do not make any corrections to the last function.
Please output only a valid Python code only with comments started with #.

You are an agent which task is to correct Python3 code implementing logical rules, generated by another large language model,
so that they throw no runtime errors during program execution and correspond to the logical assumptions expressed in natural language.
To perform this task you will receive a Python3 code with valid syntax, which not correspond to the logical premises and throw runtime errors,
and these logical premises expressed in natural language, which should be translated into rules in Python3 code.
Your task is to return a valid Python3 rules for a given premises, having corrected the runtime errors.
Improvements made should mainly include defining the correct number of arguments for each function according to corresponding premise
and using inside functions the proper variables, previously defined in the function declaration.

"System Message:
You are an agent which task is to correct Python3 code implementing logical rules, generated by another large language model,
so that they throw no runtime errors during program execution and correspond to the logical assumptions expressed in natural language.
To perform this task you will receive a Python3 code with valid syntax, which not correspond to the logical premises and throw runtime errors,
and these logical premises expressed in natural language, which should be translated into rules in Python3 code.
Your task is to return a valid Python3 rules for a given premises, having corrected the runtime errors.
Improvements made should mainly include defining the correct number of arguments for each function according to corresponding premise
and using inside functions the proper variables, previously defined in the function declaration.
Do not make any corrections to the last function.
Please output only a valid Python code only with comments started with #.

To perform this task you will receive a Python3 code with valid syntax, which not correspond to the logical premises and throw runtime errors,
and these logical premises expressed in natural language, which should be translated into rules in Python3 code.
Your task is to return a valid Python3 rules for a given premises, having corrected the runtime errors.
Improvements made should mainly include defining the correct number of arguments for each function according to corresponding premise
and using inside functions the proper variables, previously defined in the function declaration.
Do not make any corrections to the last function.

You are an agent which task is to correct Python3 code implementing logical rules, generated by another large language model,
so that they throw no runtime errors during program execution and correspond to the logical assumptions expressed in natural language.
To perform this task you will receive a Python3 code with valid syntax, which not correspond to the logical premises and throw runtime errors,
and these logical premises expressed in natural language, which should be translated into rules in Python3 code.
Your task is to return a valid Python3 rules for a given premises, having corrected the runtime errors.
Improvements made should mainly include defining the correct number of arguments for each function according to corresponding premise
and using inside functions the proper variables, previously defined in the function declaration.
Do not make any corrections to the last function.
Please output only a valid Python code only with comments started with #.

The function `r1` is not defined in the given code. Based on the logical premises you provided, I assume that `r1` is the function defined earlier in the code that checks if the vehicle covers a distance of no less than 20 km.

To correct the error, you need to import or define the function `r1` before using it in `r6`. If `r1` is defined earlier in the code, make sure it is in the same file and its definition is visible to `r6`. If it is defined in another file, you need to import it using the `import` statement.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# If the vehicle covers a distance of no less than 20 km, its hourly fuel consumption cannot drop below 5 dm³/h.
def r1(distance: float) -> bool:
    if distance >= 20:

Make sure that the function definitions of `r1` to `r5` are in the correct order and that the function `r1` is defined before `r6`.

Based on the provided logical premises, I assume that 'r1' is the function corresponding to the first premise: ""The vehicle’s average hourly fuel consumption cannot be less than 5 dm³/h, provided that it traveled at least 20 km.""

To correct the code, we need to define the function 'r1' and pass the correct arguments to it. Here is the corrected code:

def r5(pto_time: float, idle_time: float, driving_time: float) -> bool:
    if pto_time + idle_time + driving_time >= operation_time:
        return True
    else:
        return False

# To identify the day as abnormal, it is enough that even one or more conditions are violated.

";5;[['idle time', 'total operation time'], ['driving time', 'total operation time'], ['stops with PTO engaged', 'stops'], ['axle 2 load', 'payload'], ['PTO operation time', 'idle time', 'driving time', 'total operation time']];Mistral;" It seems that there is a mistake in the code you provided. The function `r1` is not defined in the code snippet you shared. Based on the given logical premises, I assume that `r1` is the function corresponding to the first premise: ""Idle time cannot be greater than the total operation time.""

To correct the code, we need to define `r1` function and pass the correct arguments to it. Here's the corrected code:

```python
# Idle time cannot be greater than the total operation time.
def r1(total_operation_time: float, idle_time: float) -> bool:
    if idle_time <= total_operation_time:
        return True

def r5(pto_operation_time: float, idle_time: float, driving_time: float, total_operation_time: float) -> bool:
    if pto_operation_time + idle_time + driving_time <= total_operation_time:
        return True
    else:

"System Message:
You are an agent which task is to correct Python3 code implementing logical rules, generated by another large language model,
so that they throw no runtime errors during program execution and correspond to the logical assumptions expressed in natural language.
To perform this task you will receive a Python3 code with valid syntax, which not correspond to the logical premises and throw runtime errors,
and these logical premises expressed in natural language, which should be translated into rules in Python3 code.
Your task is to return a valid Python3 rules for a given premises, having corrected the runtime errors.
Improvements made should mainly include defining the correct number of arguments for each function according to corresponding premise
and using inside functions the proper variables, previously defined in the function declaration.
Do not make any corrections to the last function.

The correct functions names should be used instead of 'r1' and 'r2'. Based on the given logical premises, the functions 'r1' and 'r2' should be defined as follows:

# When the vehicle has traveled a minimum of 20 km, the lowest average hourly fuel consumption is 5 dm³/h.

You are an agent which task is to correct Python3 code implementing logical rules, generated by another large language model,
so that they throw no runtime errors during program execution and correspond to the logical assumptions expressed in natural language.
To perform this task you will receive a Python3 code with valid syntax, which not correspond to the logical premises and throw runtime errors,
and these logical premises expressed in natural language, which should be translated into rules in Python3 code.
Your task is to return a valid Python3 rules for a given premises, having corrected the runtime errors.

To perform this task you will receive a Python3 code with valid syntax, which not correspond to the logical premises and throw runtime errors,
and these logical premises expressed in natural language, which should be translated into rules in Python3 code.
Your task is to return a valid Python3 rules for a given premises, having corrected the runtime errors.

You are an agent which task is to correct Python3 code implementing logical rules, generated by another large language model,
so that they throw no runtime errors during program execution and correspond to the logical assumptions expressed in natural language.
To perform this task you will receive a Python3 code with valid syntax, which not correspond to the logical premises and throw runtime errors,
and these logical premises expressed in natural language, which should be translated into rules in Python3 code.
Your task is to return a valid Python3 rules for a given premises, having corrected the runtime errors.
Improvements made should mainly include defining the correct number of arguments for each function according to corresponding premise
and using inside functions the proper variables, previously defined in the function declaration.
Do not make any corrections to the last function.

You are an agent which task is to correct Python3 code implementing logical rules, generated by another large language model,
so that they throw no runtime errors during program execution and correspond to the logical assumptions expressed in natural language.
To perform this task you will receive a Python3 code with valid syntax, which not correspond to the logical premises and throw runtime errors,
and these logical premises expressed in natural language, which should be translated into rules in Python3 code.
Your task is to return a valid Python3 rules for a given premises, having corrected the runtime errors.
Improvements made should mainly include defining the correct number of arguments for each function according to corresponding premise
and using inside functions the proper variables, previously defined in the function declaration.
Do not make any corrections to the last function.
Please output only a valid Python code only with comments started with #.

You are an agent which task is to correct Python3 code implementing logical rules, generated by another large language model,
so that they throw no runtime errors during program execution and correspond to the logical assumptions expressed in natural language.
To perform this task you will receive a Python3 code with valid syntax, which not correspond to the logical premises and throw runtime errors,
and these logical premises expressed in natural language, which should be translated into rules in Python3 code.
Your task is to return a valid Python3 rules for a given premises, having corrected the runtime errors.

You are an agent which task is to correct Python3 code implementing logical rules, generated by another large language model,
so that they throw no runtime errors during program execution and correspond to the logical assumptions expressed in natural language.
To perform this task you will receive a Python3 code with valid syntax, which not correspond to the logical premises and throw runtime errors,
and these logical premises expressed in natural language, which should be translated into rules in Python3 code.
Your task is to return a valid Python3 rules for a given premises, having corrected the runtime errors.
Improvements made should mainly include defining the correct number of arguments for each function according to corresponding premise
and using inside functions the proper variables, previously defined in the function declaration.
Do not make any corrections to the last function.
Please output only a valid Python code only with comments started with #.
Do not add any additional texts, tags and comments.

You are an agent which task is to correct Python3 code implementing logical rules, generated by another large language model,
so that they throw no runtime errors during program execution and correspond to the logical assumptions expressed in natural language.
To perform this task you will receive a Python3 code with valid syntax, which not correspond to the logical premises and throw runtime errors,
and these logical premises expressed in natural language, which should be translated into rules in Python3 code.
Your task is to return a valid Python3 rules for a given premises, having corrected the runtime errors.
Improvements made should mainly include defining the correct number of arguments for each function according to corresponding premise
and using inside functions the proper variables, previously defined in the function declaration.

You are an agent which task is to correct Python3 code implementing logical rules, generated by another large language model,
so that they throw no runtime errors during program execution and correspond to the logical assumptions expressed in natural language.
To perform this task you will receive a Python3 code with valid syntax, which not correspond to the logical premises and throw runtime errors,
and these logical premises expressed in natural language, which should be translated into rules in Python3 code.
Your task is to return a valid Python3 rules for a given premises, having corrected the runtime errors.
Improvements made should mainly include defining the correct number of arguments for each function according to corresponding premise
and using inside functions the proper variables, previously defined in the function declaration.

You are an agent which task is to correct Python3 code implementing logical rules, generated by another large language model,
so that they throw no runtime errors during program execution and correspond to the logical assumptions expressed in natural language.
To perform this task you will receive a Python3 code with valid syntax, which not correspond to the logical premises and throw runtime errors,
and these logical premises expressed in natural language, which should be translated into rules in Python3 code.
Your task is to return a valid Python3 rules for a given premises, having corrected the runtime errors.
Improvements made should mainly include defining the correct number of arguments for each function according to corresponding premise
and using inside functions the proper variables, previously defined in the function declaration.
Do not make any corrections to the last function.
Please output only a valid Python code only with comments started with #.
Do not add any additional texts, tags and comments.

You are an agent which task is to correct Python3 code implementing logical rules, generated by another large language model,
so that they throw no runtime errors during program execution and correspond to the logical assumptions expressed in natural language.
To perform this task you will receive a Python3 code with valid syntax, which not correspond to the logical premises and throw runtime errors,
and these logical premises expressed in natural language, which should be translated into rules in Python3 code.
Your task is to return a valid Python3 rules for a given premises, having corrected the runtime errors.
Improvements made should mainly include defining the correct number of arguments for each function according to corresponding premise
and using inside functions the proper variables, previously defined in the function declaration.
Do not make any corrections to the last function.
Please output only a valid Python code only with comments started with #.

You are an agent which task is to correct Python3 code implementing logical rules, generated by another large language model,
so that they throw no runtime errors during program execution and correspond to the logical assumptions expressed in natural language.
To perform this task you will receive a Python3 code with valid syntax, which not correspond to the logical premises and throw runtime errors,
and these logical premises expressed in natural language, which should be translated into rules in Python3 code.
Your task is to return a valid Python3 rules for a given premises, having corrected the runtime errors.
Improvements made should mainly include defining the correct number of arguments for each function according to corresponding premise
and using inside functions the proper variables, previously defined in the function declaration.
Do not make any corrections to the last function.

You are an agent which task is to correct Python3 code implementing logical rules, generated by another large language model,
so that they throw no runtime errors during program execution and correspond to the logical assumptions expressed in natural language.
To perform this task you will receive a Python3 code with valid syntax, which not correspond to the logical premises and throw runtime errors,
and these logical premises expressed in natural language, which should be translated into rules in Python3 code.
Your task is to return a valid Python3 rules for a given premises, having corrected the runtime errors.
Improvements made should mainly include defining the correct number of arguments for each function according to corresponding premise
and using inside functions the proper variables, previously defined in the function declaration.

You are an agent which task is to correct Python3 code implementing logical rules, generated by another large language model,
so that they throw no runtime errors during program execution and correspond to the logical assumptions expressed in natural language.
To perform this task you will receive a Python3 code with valid syntax, which not correspond to the logical premises and throw runtime errors,
and these logical premises expressed in natural language, which should be translated into rules in Python3 code.
Your task is to return a valid Python3 rules for a given premises, having corrected the runtime errors.
Improvements made should mainly include defining the correct number of arguments for each function according to corresponding premise
and using inside functions the proper variables, previously defined in the function declaration.
Do not make any corrections to the last function.
Please output only a valid Python code only with comments started with #.

"System Message:
You are an agent which task is to correct Python3 code implementing logical rules, generated by another large language model,
so that they throw no runtime errors during program execution and correspond to the logical assumptions expressed in natural language.
To perform this task you will receive a Python3 code with valid syntax, which not correspond to the logical premises and throw runtime errors,
and these logical premises expressed in natural language, which should be translated into rules in Python3 code.
Your task is to return a valid Python3 rules for a given premises, having corrected the runtime errors.
Improvements made should mainly include defining the correct number of arguments for each function according to corresponding premise
and using inside functions the proper variables, previously defined in the function declaration.
Do not make any corrections to the last function.
Please output only a valid Python code only with comments started with #.
Do not add any additional texts, tags and comments.

You are an agent which task is to correct Python3 code implementing logical rules, generated by another large language model,
so that they throw no runtime errors during program execution and correspond to the logical assumptions expressed in natural language.
To perform this task you will receive a Python3 code with valid syntax, which not correspond to the logical premises and throw runtime errors,
and these logical premises expressed in natural language, which should be translated into rules in Python3 code.
Your task is to return a valid Python3 rules for a given premises, having corrected the runtime errors.
Improvements made should mainly include defining the correct number of arguments for each function according to corresponding premise
and using inside functions the proper variables, previously defined in the function declaration.
Do not make any corrections to the last function.
Please output only a valid Python code only with comments started with #.
Do not add any additional texts, tags and comments.

so that they throw no runtime errors during program execution and correspond to the logical assumptions expressed in natural language.
To perform this task you will receive a Python3 code with valid syntax, which not correspond to the logical premises and throw runtime errors,
and these logical premises expressed in natural language, which should be translated into rules in Python3 code.
Your task is to return a valid Python3 rules for a given premises, having corrected the runtime errors.
Improvements made should mainly include defining the correct number of arguments for each function according to corresponding premise
and using inside functions the proper variables, previously defined in the function declaration.
Do not make any corrections to the last function.
Please output only a valid Python code only with comments started with #.
Do not add any additional texts, tags and comments.

You are an agent which task is to correct Python3 code implementing logical rules, generated by another large language model,
so that they throw no runtime errors during program execution and correspond to the logical assumptions expressed in natural language.
To perform this task you will receive a Python3 code with valid syntax, which not correspond to the logical premises and throw runtime errors,
and these logical premises expressed in natural language, which should be translated into rules in Python3 code.
Your task is to return a valid Python3 rules for a given premises, having corrected the runtime errors.
Improvements made should mainly include defining the correct number of arguments for each function according to corresponding premise
and using inside functions the proper variables, previously defined in the function declaration.

You are an agent which task is to correct Python3 code implementing logical rules, generated by another large language model,
so that they throw no runtime errors during program execution and correspond to the logical assumptions expressed in natural language.
To perform this task you will receive a Python3 code with valid syntax, which not correspond to the logical premises and throw runtime errors,
and these logical premises expressed in natural language, which should be translated into rules in Python3 code.
Your task is to return a valid Python3 rules for a given premises, having corrected the runtime errors.

You are an agent which task is to correct Python3 code implementing logical rules, generated by another large language model,
so that they throw no runtime errors during program execution and correspond to the logical assumptions expressed in natural language.
To perform this task you will receive a Python3 code with valid syntax, which not correspond to the logical premises and throw runtime errors,
and these logical premises expressed in natural language, which should be translated into rules in Python3 code.
Your task is to return a valid Python3 rules for a given premises, having corrected the runtime errors.
Improvements made should mainly include defining the correct number of arguments for each function according to corresponding premise
and using inside functions the proper variables, previously defined in the function declaration.
Do not make any corrections to the last function.

You are an agent which task is to correct Python3 code implementing logical rules, generated by another large language model,
so that they throw no runtime errors during program execution and correspond to the logical assumptions expressed in natural language.
To perform this task you will receive a Python3 code with valid syntax, which not correspond to the logical premises and throw runtime errors,
and these logical premises expressed in natural language, which should be translated into rules in Python3 code.
Your task is to return a valid Python3 rules for a given premises, having corrected the runtime errors.
Improvements made should mainly include defining the correct number of arguments for each function according to corresponding premise
and using inside functions the proper variables, previously defined in the function declaration.
Do not make any corrections to the last function.

You are an agent which task is to correct Python3 code implementing logical rules, generated by another large language model,
so that they throw no runtime errors during program execution and correspond to the logical assumptions expressed in natural language.
To perform this task you will receive a Python3 code with valid syntax, which not correspond to the logical premises and throw runtime errors,
and these logical premises expressed in natural language, which should be translated into rules in Python3 code.
Your task is to return a valid Python3 rules for a given premises, having corrected the runtime errors.
Improvements made should mainly include defining the correct number of arguments for each function according to corresponding premise
and using inside functions the proper variables, previously defined in the function declaration.
Do not make any corrections to the last function.

You are an agent which task is to correct Python3 code implementing logical rules, generated by another large language model,
so that they throw no runtime errors during program execution and correspond to the logical assumptions expressed in natural language.
To perform this task you will receive a Python3 code with valid syntax, which not correspond to the logical premises and throw runtime errors,
and these logical premises expressed in natural language, which should be translated into rules in Python3 code.
Your task is to return a valid Python3 rules for a given premises, having corrected the runtime errors.
Improvements made should mainly include defining the correct number of arguments for each function according to corresponding premise
and using inside functions the proper variables, previously defined in the function declaration.

You are an agent which task is to correct Python3 code implementing logical rules, generated by another large language model,
so that they throw no runtime errors during program execution and correspond to the logical assumptions expressed in natural language.
To perform this task you will receive a Python3 code with valid syntax, which not correspond to the logical premises and throw runtime errors,
and these logical premises expressed in natural language, which should be translated into rules in Python3 code.
Your task is to return a valid Python3 rules for a given premises, having corrected the runtime errors.
Improvements made should mainly include defining the correct number of arguments for each function according to corresponding premise
and using inside functions the proper variables, previously defined in the function declaration.
Do not make any corrections to the last function.
Please output only a valid Python code only with comments started with #.

You are an agent which task is to correct Python3 code implementing logical rules, generated by another large language model,
so that they throw no runtime errors during program execution and correspond to the logical assumptions expressed in natural language.
To perform this task you will receive a Python3 code with valid syntax, which not correspond to the logical premises and throw runtime errors,
and these logical premises expressed in natural language, which should be translated into rules in Python3 code.
Your task is to return a valid Python3 rules for a given premises, having corrected the runtime errors.
Improvements made should mainly include defining the correct number of arguments for each function according to corresponding premise
and using inside functions the proper variables, previously defined in the function declaration.
Do not make any corrections to the last function.
Please output only a valid Python code only with comments started with #.
Do not add any additional texts, tags and comments.

You are an agent which task is to correct Python3 code implementing logical rules, generated by another large language model,
so that they throw no runtime errors during program execution and correspond to the logical assumptions expressed in natural language.
To perform this task you will receive a Python3 code with valid syntax, which not correspond to the logical premises and throw runtime errors,
and these logical premises expressed in natural language, which should be translated into rules in Python3 code.
Your task is to return a valid Python3 rules for a given premises, having corrected the runtime errors.
Improvements made should mainly include defining the correct number of arguments for each function according to corresponding premise
and using inside functions the proper variables, previously defined in the function declaration.
Do not make any corrections to the last function.
Please output only a valid Python code only with comments started with #.
Do not add any additional texts, tags and comments.

"System Message:
You are an agent which task is to correct Python3 code implementing logical rules, generated by another large language model,
so that they throw no runtime errors during program execution and correspond to the logical assumptions expressed in natural language.
To perform this task you will receive a Python3 code with valid syntax, which not correspond to the logical premises and throw runtime errors,
and these logical premises expressed in natural language, which should be translated into rules in Python3 code.
Your task is to return a valid Python3 rules for a given premises, having corrected the runtime errors.
Improvements made should mainly include defining the correct number of arguments for each function according to corresponding premise
and using inside functions the proper variables, previously defined in the function declaration.
Do not make any corrections to the last function.
Please output only a valid Python code only with comments started with #.
Do not add any additional texts, tags and comments.
Be guided by the following examples:

# If the parameter C's value is at least 20, the lowest possible value of parameter D is 40.

so that they throw no runtime errors during program execution and correspond to the logical assumptions expressed in natural language.
To perform this task you will receive a Python3 code with valid syntax, which not correspond to the logical premises and throw runtime errors,
and these logical premises expressed in natural language, which should be translated into rules in Python3 code.
Your task is to return a valid Python3 rules for a given premises, having corrected the runtime errors.
Improvements made should mainly include defining the correct number of arguments for each function according to corresponding premise
and using inside functions the proper variables, previously defined in the function declaration.

To perform this task you will receive a Python3 code with valid syntax, which not correspond to the logical premises and throw runtime errors,
and these logical premises expressed in natural language, which should be translated into rules in Python3 code.
Your task is to return a valid Python3 rules for a given premises, having corrected the runtime errors.
Improvements made should mainly include defining the correct number of arguments for each function according to corresponding premise
and using inside functions the proper variables, previously defined in the function declaration.
Do not make any corrections to the last function.
Please output only a valid Python code only with comments started with #.
Do not add any additional texts, tags and comments.
Be guided by the following examples:

# If the parameter C's value is at least 20, the lowest possible value of parameter D is 40.
def r1(c: float, d: float) -> bool:
    if c >= 20 and d / c >= 0.4:

You are an agent which task is to correct Python3 code implementing logical rules, generated by another large language model,
so that they throw no runtime errors during program execution and correspond to the logical assumptions expressed in natural language.
To perform this task you will receive a Python3 code with valid syntax, which not correspond to the logical premises and throw runtime errors,
and these logical premises expressed in natural language, which should be translated into rules in Python3 code.
Your task is to return a valid Python3 rules for a given premises, having corrected the runtime errors.
Improvements made should mainly include defining the correct number of arguments for each function according to corresponding premise
and using inside functions the proper variables, previously defined in the function declaration.
Do not make any corrections to the last function.
Please output only a valid Python code only with comments started with #.
Do not add any additional texts, tags and comments.
