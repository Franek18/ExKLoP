**Explanation:**

* The code follows the same structure as the example input text and Python3 code.
* The variable `s` is used to represent the speed of the vehicle, and the variable `c` is used to represent the number of compaction cycles.
* The rules `r1` and `r2` define the constraints on speed and compaction cycles, respectively.
* The constraints are defined using the comparison operators `<=` and `>=`.<eos>"

**Explanation:**

* The input text describes two constraints:
    * The number of stops with the PTO engaged ranges from 20 to 250.
    * The vehicle's speed is limited to 0 to 80 km/h.
* The code defines two functions, `r1` and `r2`, to represent these constraints.
* `r1` takes an integer `a` representing the number of stops and returns `True` if the number of stops is between 20 and 250.
* `r2` takes a float `b` representing the speed and returns `True` if the speed is between 0 and 80 km/h.<eos>"

        Be guided by the following example:
        Example input text:
        Textual context: A vehicle operates over a A param between 20 and 110 in a typical day.
A vehicle operates for a B param between 2 and 10 in a typical day.

        Example Python3 code:
        # A vehicle operates over a A param between 20 and 110 in a typical day.
def r1(a: float) -> bool:
    return 20 <= a <= 110

# A vehicle operates for a B param between 2 and 10 in a typical day.
def r2(b: float) -> bool:
    return 2 <= b <= 10


        
Input text:
Textual context: On a usual day, a vehicle travels between 20 and 110 km.
It is infrequent for a vehicle to operate for fewer than 2 hours or more than 10 hours in a typical day.
";"```

**Output Code:**

```python
def r1(a: float) -> bool:
    return 20 <= a <= 110

def r2(b: float) -> bool:
    return 2 <= b <= 10

def r3(c: float) -> bool:
    return 20 <= c <= 110

def r4(d: float) -> bool:
    return 2 <= d <= 10
```

**Explanation:**

* The code defines four rules:
    * `r1`: Vehicle speed is between 20 and 110 km/h.
    * `r2`: Vehicle operating time is between 2 and 10 hours.
    * `r3`: Distance traveled is between 20 and 110 km.
    * `r4`: Operating time is between 2 and 10 hours.
* The variables used are:
    * `a`: Vehicle speed
    * `b`: Vehicle operating time
    * `c`: Distance traveled
    * `d`: Operating time<eos>"

A vehicle operates for a B param between 2 and 10 in a typical day.
A vehicle operates with C param between 0.2 and 5 in a typical day.

        Example Python3 code:
        # A vehicle operates over a A param between 20 and 110 in a typical day.
def r1(a: float) -> bool:
    return 20 <= a <= 110

# A vehicle operates for a B param between 2 and 10 in a typical day.

Input text:
Textual context: It is unlikely for axle 1 to carry less than 2000 kg or more than 8000 kg in a day.
It is infrequent for axle 3 to carry less than 4500 kg or more than 7500 kg in a day.
Typically, a vehicle consumes 10 to 100 dmÂ³ of fuel in a day.
";"```

**Output Code:**

```python
def r1(a: float) -> bool:
    return 2000 <= a <= 8000

def r2(a: float) -> bool:
    return 4500 <= a <= 7500

def r3(a: float) -> bool:
    return 10 <= a <= 100
```

**Explanation:**

* The code follows the same structure as the example input text and Python3 code.
* The variables are defined as follows:
    * `a` represents the weight of axle 1.
    * `b` represents the weight of axle 3.
    * `c` represents the fuel consumption of the vehicle.
* The rules are defined as follows:
    * `r1`: The weight of axle 1 is between 2000 kg and 8000 kg.
    * `r2`: The weight of axle 3 is between 4500 kg and 7500 kg.
    * `r3`: The fuel consumption of the vehicle is between 10 dmÂ³ and 100 dmÂ³.<eos>"

* The range of values for variable A was adjusted to be between 1 and 5, as it is not common for a vehicle to spend less than 1 hour or more than 5 hours driving in a day.
* The variable for the number of stops was changed to an integer (b), as it is a whole number.
* The range of values for variable C was adjusted to be between 2000 and 8000 kg, as it is not common for axle 1 to carry less than 2000 kg or more than 8000 kg in a day.
* The range of values for variable D was not redefined, as the given range (0.08 to 0.2 hours) is appropriate for refueling a vehicle.<eos>"

```

**Explanation:**

* The provided input text describes constraints related to operating time, stops, PTO engagement, and axle load.
* The code defines three rules based on the input text:
    * **r1:** Vehicle operating time is between 2 and 10 hours.
    * **r2:** Axle load is between 7000 and 11500 kg.
    * **r3:** Number of stops is between 50 and 300.
* The rules are defined as functions that take a single argument representing the relevant parameter (operating time, axle load, or number of stops) and return `True` or `False` based on the constraint.<eos>"

    * `c`: operating parameter (0-5)
    * `d`: remaining fuel (1-5 dmÂ³)
    * `e`: spending time (1-5)
    * `f`: load on axle 1 (2000-8000 kg)
    * `g`: load on axle 2 (7000-11500 kg)
    * `h`: fuel consumption (10-100 dmÂ³)
* The rules are defined using the `def` statement and the appropriate data type for each variable.
* The `->` symbol indicates the direction of the implication, with the left-hand side representing the premise and the right-hand side representing the conclusion.<eos>"

# A vehicle makes between 20 and 250 G param in a typical day.
def r7(g: float) -> bool:
    return 20 <= g <= 250


        
Input text:
Textual context: Each day, a vehicle makes 20 to 250 stops with the PTO in use.
It is infrequent for a vehicle's engine speed to fall outside the range of 550 to 1600 rpm in a day.
In a typical day, a vehicle's axle 1 load is between 2000 and 8000 kg.
It is unusual for axle 2 to carry less than 7000 kg or more than 11500 kg in a day.
It is uncommon for axle 3 to carry less than 4500 kg or more than 7500 kg in a day.
It is not typical for a vehicle to have a payload outside the range of 0 to 11000 kg in a day.
It is unusual for a vehicle to consume less than 10 dmÂ³ or more than 100 dmÂ³ of fuel in a day.
";"```

**Output Code:**

```python
def r1(a: int) -> bool:
    return 20 <= a <= 250

def r2(b: float) -> bool:
    return 550 <= b <= 1600

def r3(c: int) -> bool:
    return 2000 <= c <= 8000

def r4(d: int) -> bool:
    return 7000 <= d <= 11500

def r5(e: int) -> bool:
    return 4500 <= e <= 7500

def r6(f: int) -> bool:
    return 0 <= f <= 11000

def r7(g: float) -> bool:
    return 10 <= g <= 100
```

**Explanation:**

* The input text is about the performance of a vehicle.
* The output code defines seven rules based on the input text.
* Each rule is a function that takes a relevant parameter and returns `True` or `False` depending on whether the condition is met.
* The variable names are chosen to reflect the context of the rules.
* The data types of the parameters are specified for clarity and to ensure correct operation.<eos>"

Input text:
Textual context: A vehicle's operational hours range from 2 to 10 in a typical day.
In a typical day, a vehicle idles for 1 to 5 hours.
Normally, a vehicle makes 20 to 300 stops in a day.
In a usual day, the engine speed of a vehicle is between 550 and 1600 rpm.
Each day, axle 1 carries between 2000 and 8000 kg of load.
On a usual day, a vehicle's payload ranges from 0 to 11000 kg.
It is unusual for a vehicle to consume less than 10 dmÂ³ or more than 100 dmÂ³ of fuel in a day.
On a normal day, a vehicle performs 50 to 300 compaction cycles.
Refueling a vehicle takes 0.08 to 0.2 hours in a typical day.

```

**Explanation:**

* The input text is about the operational characteristics of a vehicle.
* The output code defines nine functions, each representing a rule derived from the input text.
* The variables used in the rules are:
    * `a`: operational hours
    * `b`: idling time
    * `c`: number of stops
    * `d`: engine speed
    * `e`: load on axle 1
    * `f`: payload
    * `g`: fuel consumption
    * `h`: compaction cycles
    * `i`: refueling time
* The data types of the variables are chosen based on the context of the rules.
* The functions return `True` or `False` depending on whether the rule is satisfied.<eos>"

* The code follows the same pattern as the example input text and code.
* Each rule is defined as a function that takes a single argument representing the relevant parameter and returns `True` or `False` depending on the condition.
* The names of the functions and parameters are based on the context of the input text.
* The conditions for each rule are derived from the constraints stated in the input text.<eos>"

**Explanation:**

* The code follows the same pattern as the previous example, defining functions that represent the textual constraints.
* Each function takes a single argument representing the relevant parameter (e.g., time, stops, engine speed, load) and returns `True` or `False` depending on whether the constraint is met.
* The constraints are translated directly from the natural language text, paying close attention to the defined variables and their ranges.<eos>"

Input text:
Textual context: On a usual day, a vehicle travels between 20 and 110 km.
It is not typical for the PTO to be engaged for under 0.2 hours or over 5 hours in a day.
It is not common for a vehicle to drive for less than 1 hour or more than 5 hours in a day.
Each typical day, a vehicle stops between 20 and 300 times.
Usually, a vehicle makes 20 to 250 stops with the PTO engaged per day.
In a usual day, the engine speed of a vehicle is between 550 and 1600 rpm.
In a typical day, a vehicle's axle 1 load is between 2000 and 8000 kg.
In a typical day, a vehicle's axle 3 load is between 4500 and 7500 kg.
In a typical day, a vehicle performs 50 to 300 compaction cycles.
It is infrequent for a vehicle to complete fewer than 50 or more than 300 lifter cycles in a day.
It is unusual for a vehicle to take less than 0.08 hours or more than 0.2 hours to refuel in a day.

**Explanation:**

* The code follows the same structure as the example input text and Python3 code provided.
* Each rule is defined as a function that takes a single argument representing the relevant parameter and returns `True` or `False` depending on the condition.
* The conditions are derived from the textual context and are translated directly into Python3 code.
* Variable names are chosen based on the context of the rules.<eos>"
