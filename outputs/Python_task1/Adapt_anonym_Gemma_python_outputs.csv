        During the translation, please pay close attention to defining variables and rules.
        Do not add any comments from you.
        Be guided by the following example:
        Example input text:
        Textual context: # A vehicle operates over a A param between 20 and 110 in a typical day.
# A vehicle operates for a B param between 2 and 10 in a typical day.
# A vehicle operates with C param between 0.2 and 5 in a typical day.
# A vehicle remains D param between 1 and 5 in a typical day.

        Example Python3 code:
        # A vehicle operates over a A param between 20 and 110 in a typical day.
def r1(a: float) -> bool:
    return 20 <= a <= 110

# A vehicle operates for a B param between 2 and 10 in a typical day.
def r2(b: float) -> bool:
    return 2 <= b <= 10

# A vehicle operates with C param between 0.2 and 5 in a typical day.
def r3(c: float) -> bool:
    return 0.2 <= c <= 5

# A vehicle remains D param between 1 and 5 in a typical day.

   return not (r1(x1) and r2(x2) and r3(x3) and r4(x4))
        
Input text:
Textual context: It is unusual for the PTO to be engaged for less than 0.2 hours or more than 5 hours in a day.
It is unlikely for axle 1 to carry less than 2000 kg or more than 8000 kg in a day.
It is unusual for a vehicle to consume less than 10 dm³ or more than 100 dm³ of fuel in a day.
In a typical day, a vehicle completes 50 to 300 lifter cycles.
To identify the day as abnormal, it is enough that even one or more conditions are violated.";"

**Expected Output:**
Define the necessary variables and rules in Python3 code based on the input text.
```python
# ...
```

**Note:** The expected output should be a set of functions that represent the rules defined in the input text. Each function should take the relevant variable as an argument and return `True` or `False` depending on whether the condition is met.

**Hint:** Pay close attention to the last sentence of the input text, which states that a day is abnormal if any of the given conditions are violated. This implies that you need to define a function that checks if any of the other defined functions are `False`.<eos>"

* Variables are defined for each parameter mentioned in the input text.
* Rules are defined for each condition described in the input text.
* The final rule `r7` checks if any of the defined rules are violated.
* The `not` operator in `r7` ensures that if any of the conditions are not met, the day is identified as abnormal.<eos>"

Input text:
Textual context: During a typical day, a vehicle covers a distance of 20 to 110 km.
It is not typical for the PTO to be engaged for under 0.2 hours or over 5 hours in a day.
In a typical day, a vehicle idles for 1 to 5 hours.
Normally, a vehicle makes 20 to 300 stops in a day.
It is rare for a vehicle to operate outside the speed range of 0 to 80 km/h in a typical day.
It is unlikely for axle 1 to carry less than 2000 kg or more than 8000 kg in a day.
Typically, a vehicle consumes 10 to 100 dm³ of fuel in a day.
On a normal day, a vehicle completes 50 to 300 lifter cycles.
To identify the day as abnormal, it is enough that even one or more conditions are violated.";"

**Expected Output:**
Define the necessary variables and rules based on the input text and translate them into Python3 code.
```python
# ...
```

**Note:** The code should follow the same structure as the example provided.

**Variables:**
- `distance`: Distance covered by the vehicle in km
- `pto_time`: Time PTO is engaged in hours
- `idle_time`: Time vehicle is idling in hours
- `stops`: Number of stops made by the vehicle
- `speed`: Speed of the vehicle in km/h
- `axle_load`: Weight on axle 1 in kg
- `fuel_consumption`: Fuel consumption of the vehicle in dm³
- `lifter_cycles`: Number of lifter cycles completed by the vehicle

**Rules:**
- Distance covered is between 20 and 110 km
- PTO time is not under 0.2 hours or over 5 hours
- Idling time is between 1 and 5 hours
- Number of stops is between 20 and 300
- Speed is between 0 and 80 km/h
- Axle load is between 2000 and 8000 kg
- Fuel consumption is between 10 and 100 dm³
- Lifter cycles are between 50 and 300

**Note:** The `r9` function should be defined to identify the day as abnormal if any of the defined rules are violated.<eos>"

**Expected Output:**
Define the necessary variables and rules based on the input text and translate them into Python3 code.
```python
# ...
```

**Note:** The code should follow the same structure as the example provided.

**Variables:**
- `a`: distance traveled
- `b`: PTO operating time
- `c`: idling time
- `d`: number of stops with PTO engaged
- `e`: number of stops in a day
- `f`: load on axle 1
- `g`: load on axle 3
- `h`: number of compaction cycles
- `i`: number of lifter cycles

**Rules:**
- Distance traveled: `20 <= a <= 110`
- PTO operating time: `0.2 <= b <= 5`
- Idling time: `1 <= c <= 5`
- Number of stops with PTO engaged: `e < 20 or e > 250`
- Load on axle 1: `2000 <= f <= 8000`
- Load on axle 3: `4500 <= g <= 7500`
- Compaction cycles: `50 <= h <= 300`
- Lifter cycles: `50 <= i <= 300`

**Note:** The `r9` function is not required in the expected output as it is already defined in the example code.<eos>"

Textual context: On a usual day, a vehicle travels between 20 and 110 km.
A vehicle's operational hours range from 2 to 10 in a typical day.
A vehicle's PTO operates for 0.2 to 5 hours in a typical day.
It is rare for a vehicle to idle for less than 1 hour or more than 5 hours in a day.
A vehicle spends 1 to 5 hours driving each typical day.
It is infrequent for a vehicle to make fewer than 20 stops or exceed 300 stops in a day.
A vehicle making fewer than 20 stops with PTO engaged or more than 250 stops in a day is uncommon.
On a normal day, a vehicle’s speed ranges from 0 to 80 km/h.
On a typical day, a vehicle's engine operates at 550 to 1600 rpm.
It is unusual for a vehicle to take less than 0.08 hours or more than 0.2 hours to refuel in a day.
To identify the day as abnormal, it is enough that even one or more conditions are violated.";"

Typically, a vehicle idles for 1 to 5 hours daily.
It is not common for a vehicle to drive for less than 1 hour or more than 5 hours in a day.
Each typical day, a vehicle stops between 20 and 300 times.
It is not typical for a vehicle to make fewer than 20 stops with the PTO engaged or exceed 250 stops in a day.
In a typical day, a vehicle's speed ranges from 0 to 80 km/h.
In a typical day, a vehicle's axle 2 load is between 7000 and 11500 kg.
In a typical day, a vehicle's axle 3 load is between 4500 and 7500 kg.
A vehicle's payload varies from 0 to 11000 kg in a typical day.
In a typical day, a vehicle's total fuel consumption is between 10 and 100 dm³.
On a normal day, a vehicle performs 50 to 300 compaction cycles.
It is unusual for a vehicle to take less than 0.08 hours or more than 0.2 hours to refuel in a day.

Textual context: In a typical day, a vehicle's PTO is engaged for 0.2 to 5 hours.
Typically, a vehicle idles for 1 to 5 hours daily.
In a typical day, a vehicle spends 1 to 5 hours driving.
A vehicle making fewer than 20 stops with PTO engaged or more than 250 stops in a day is uncommon.
In a typical day, a vehicle's speed ranges from 0 to 80 km/h.
In a typical day, a vehicle's engine speed is between 550 and 1600 rpm.
On a typical day, the load on axle 1 ranges from 2000 to 8000 kg.
On a typical day, the load on axle 2 ranges from 7000 to 11500 kg.
Each day, axle 3 carries between 4500 and 7500 kg of load.
A payload outside the range of 0 to 11000 kg in a day is unlikely for a vehicle.
It is unlikely for a vehicle to complete fewer than 50 or more than 300 lifter cycles in a day.
In a typical day, a vehicle refuels for 0.08 to 0.2 hours.

Input text:
Textual context: On a usual day, a vehicle travels between 20 and 110 km.
In a typical day, a vehicle's total operational time ranges from 2 to 10 hours.
Typically, a vehicle idles for 1 to 5 hours daily.
In a typical day, a vehicle spends 1 to 5 hours driving.
It is infrequent for a vehicle to make fewer than 20 stops or exceed 300 stops in a day.
In a typical day, a vehicle makes 20 to 250 stops with the PTO engaged.
On a typical day, a vehicle's speed varies between 0 and 80 km/h.
It is uncommon for a vehicle's engine speed to be outside the range of 550 to 1600 rpm in a day.
On a usual day, a vehicle's payload ranges from 0 to 11000 kg.
It is unusual for a vehicle to consume less than 10 dm³ or more than 100 dm³ of fuel in a day.
It is uncommon for a vehicle to perform fewer than 50 or more than 300 compaction cycles in a day.
In a typical day, a vehicle refuels for 0.08 to 0.2 hours.
To identify the day as abnormal, it is enough that even one or more conditions are violated.";"
