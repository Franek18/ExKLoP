**Explanation:**

* The code follows the same structure as the example input text and Python3 code.
* The variable `s` is used to represent the speed of the vehicle, and the variable `c` is used to represent the number of compaction cycles.
* The rules `r1` and `r2` define the constraints on speed and compaction cycles, respectively.
* The constraints are defined using the comparison operators `<=` and `>=`.<eos>"

**Explanation:**

* The input text describes two constraints:
    * The number of stops with the PTO engaged ranges from 20 to 250.
    * The vehicle's speed is limited to 0 to 80 km/h.
* The code defines two functions, `r1` and `r2`, to represent these constraints.
* `r1` takes an integer `a` representing the number of stops and returns `True` if the number of stops is between 20 and 250.
* `r2` takes a float `b` representing the speed and returns `True` if the speed is between 0 and 80 km/h.<eos>"

        Textual context: A vehicle operates over a A param between 20 and 110 in a typical day.
A vehicle operates for a B param between 2 and 10 in a typical day.

        Example Python3 code:
        # A vehicle operates over a A param between 20 and 110 in a typical day.
def r1(a: float) -> bool:
    return 20 <= a <= 110

# A vehicle operates for a B param between 2 and 10 in a typical day.
def r2(b: float) -> bool:
    return 2 <= b <= 10


        
Input text:
Textual context: On a usual day, a vehicle travels between 20 and 110 km.
It is infrequent for a vehicle to operate for fewer than 2 hours or more than 10 hours in a typical day.
";"```

**Output Code:**

```python
def r1(a: float) -> bool:
    return 20 <= a <= 110

def r2(b: float) -> bool:
    return 2 <= b <= 10

def r3(c: float) -> bool:
    return 20 <= c <= 110

def r4(d: float) -> bool:
    return 2 <= d <= 10
```

**Explanation:**

* The code defines four rules:
    * `r1`: Vehicle speed is between 20 and 110 km/h.
    * `r2`: Vehicle operating time is between 2 and 10 hours.
    * `r3`: Distance traveled is between 20 and 110 km.
    * `r4`: Operating time is between 2 and 10 hours.
* The variables used are:
    * `a`: Vehicle speed
    * `b`: Vehicle operating time
    * `c`: Distance traveled
    * `d`: Operating time<eos>"

        Textual context: A vehicle operates over a A param between 20 and 110 in a typical day.
A vehicle operates for a B param between 2 and 10 in a typical day.
A vehicle operates with C param between 0.2 and 5 in a typical day.

        Example Python3 code:
        # A vehicle operates over a A param between 20 and 110 in a typical day.
def r1(a: float) -> bool:
    return 20 <= a <= 110

# A vehicle operates for a B param between 2 and 10 in a typical day.
def r2(b: float) -> bool:
    return 2 <= b <= 10

# A vehicle operates with C param between 0.2 and 5 in a typical day.
def r3(c: float) -> bool:
    return 0.2 <= c <= 5


        
Input text:
Textual context: It is unlikely for axle 1 to carry less than 2000 kg or more than 8000 kg in a day.
It is infrequent for axle 3 to carry less than 4500 kg or more than 7500 kg in a day.
Typically, a vehicle consumes 10 to 100 dm³ of fuel in a day.
";"```

**Output Code:**

```python
def r1(a: float) -> bool:
    return 2000 <= a <= 8000

def r2(a: float) -> bool:
    return 4500 <= a <= 7500

def r3(a: float) -> bool:
    return 10 <= a <= 100
```

**Explanation:**

* The code follows the same structure as the example input text and Python3 code.
* The variables are defined as follows:
    * `a` represents the weight of axle 1.
    * `b` represents the weight of axle 3.
    * `c` represents the fuel consumption of the vehicle.
* The rules are defined as follows:
    * `r1`: The weight of axle 1 is between 2000 kg and 8000 kg.
    * `r2`: The weight of axle 3 is between 4500 kg and 7500 kg.
    * `r3`: The fuel consumption of the vehicle is between 10 dm³ and 100 dm³.<eos>"

Textual context: It is infrequent for a vehicle to operate for fewer than 2 hours or more than 10 hours in a typical day.
It is unlikely for a vehicle to make fewer than 20 stops or more than 300 stops in a day.
A vehicle making fewer than 20 stops with PTO engaged or more than 250 stops in a day is uncommon.
On a typical day, the load on axle 2 ranges from 7000 to 11500 kg.
In a typical day, a vehicle performs 50 to 300 lifter cycles.

    return 7000 <= b <= 11500

def r3(c: float) -> bool:
    return 50 <= c <= 300
```

**Explanation:**

* The provided input text describes constraints related to operating time, stops, PTO engagement, and axle load.
* The code defines three rules based on the input text:
    * **r1:** Vehicle operating time is between 2 and 10 hours.
    * **r2:** Axle load is between 7000 and 11500 kg.
    * **r3:** Number of stops is between 50 and 300.
* The rules are defined as functions that take a single argument representing the relevant parameter (operating time, axle load, or number of stops) and return `True` or `False` based on the constraint.<eos>"

    * `c`: operating parameter (0-5)
    * `d`: remaining fuel (1-5 dm³)
    * `e`: spending time (1-5)
    * `f`: load on axle 1 (2000-8000 kg)
    * `g`: load on axle 2 (7000-11500 kg)
    * `h`: fuel consumption (10-100 dm³)
* The rules are defined using the `def` statement and the appropriate data type for each variable.
* The `->` symbol indicates the direction of the implication, with the left-hand side representing the premise and the right-hand side representing the conclusion.<eos>"

Input text:
Textual context: Each day, a vehicle makes 20 to 250 stops with the PTO in use.
It is infrequent for a vehicle's engine speed to fall outside the range of 550 to 1600 rpm in a day.
In a typical day, a vehicle's axle 1 load is between 2000 and 8000 kg.
It is unusual for axle 2 to carry less than 7000 kg or more than 11500 kg in a day.
It is uncommon for axle 3 to carry less than 4500 kg or more than 7500 kg in a day.
It is not typical for a vehicle to have a payload outside the range of 0 to 11000 kg in a day.
It is unusual for a vehicle to consume less than 10 dm³ or more than 100 dm³ of fuel in a day.
";"```

**Output Code:**

```python
def r1(a: int) -> bool:
    return 20 <= a <= 250

def r2(b: float) -> bool:
    return 550 <= b <= 1600

def r3(c: int) -> bool:
    return 2000 <= c <= 8000

    return 10 <= g <= 100
```

**Explanation:**

* The input text is about the performance of a vehicle.
* The output code defines seven rules based on the input text.
* Each rule is a function that takes a relevant parameter and returns `True` or `False` depending on whether the condition is met.
* The variable names are chosen to reflect the context of the rules.
* The data types of the parameters are specified for clarity and to ensure correct operation.<eos>"

Input text:
Textual context: A vehicle's operational hours range from 2 to 10 in a typical day.
In a typical day, a vehicle idles for 1 to 5 hours.
Normally, a vehicle makes 20 to 300 stops in a day.
In a usual day, the engine speed of a vehicle is between 550 and 1600 rpm.
Each day, axle 1 carries between 2000 and 8000 kg of load.
On a usual day, a vehicle's payload ranges from 0 to 11000 kg.
It is unusual for a vehicle to consume less than 10 dm³ or more than 100 dm³ of fuel in a day.
On a normal day, a vehicle performs 50 to 300 compaction cycles.
Refueling a vehicle takes 0.08 to 0.2 hours in a typical day.

**Output Code:**

```python
def r1(a: int) -> bool:
    return 2 <= a <= 10

def r2(b: int) -> bool:
    return 1 <= b <= 5

def r3(c: int) -> bool:

```

**Explanation:**

* The input text is about the operational characteristics of a vehicle.
* The output code defines nine functions, each representing a rule derived from the input text.
* The variables used in the rules are:
    * `a`: operational hours
    * `b`: idling time
    * `c`: number of stops
    * `d`: engine speed
    * `e`: load on axle 1
    * `f`: payload
    * `g`: fuel consumption
    * `h`: compaction cycles
    * `i`: refueling time
* The data types of the variables are chosen based on the context of the rules.
* The functions return `True` or `False` depending on whether the rule is satisfied.<eos>"

Input text:
Textual context: In a typical day, a vehicle travels between 20 and 110 km.
A vehicle typically operates for 2 to 10 hours each day.
It is not typical for the PTO to be engaged for under 0.2 hours or over 5 hours in a day.
It is rare for a vehicle to idle for less than 1 hour or more than 5 hours in a day.
During a normal day, a vehicle is driven for 1 to 5 hours.
It is infrequent for a vehicle to make fewer than 20 stops or exceed 300 stops in a day.
In a typical day, a vehicle's axle 1 load is between 2000 and 8000 kg.
It is unusual for axle 2 to carry less than 7000 kg or more than 11500 kg in a day.
It is rare for a vehicle to consume less than 10 dm³ or more than 100 dm³ of fuel in a day.
In a typical day, a vehicle completes 50 to 300 compaction cycles.
It is not typical for a vehicle to refuel in less than 0.08 hours or more than 0.2 hours in a day.

**Explanation:**

* The code follows the same pattern as the previous example, defining functions that represent the textual constraints.
* Each function takes a single argument representing the relevant parameter (e.g., time, stops, engine speed, load) and returns `True` or `False` depending on whether the constraint is met.
* The constraints are translated directly from the natural language text, paying close attention to the defined variables and their ranges.<eos>"

Input text:
Textual context: On a usual day, a vehicle travels between 20 and 110 km.
It is not typical for the PTO to be engaged for under 0.2 hours or over 5 hours in a day.
It is not common for a vehicle to drive for less than 1 hour or more than 5 hours in a day.
Each typical day, a vehicle stops between 20 and 300 times.
Usually, a vehicle makes 20 to 250 stops with the PTO engaged per day.
In a usual day, the engine speed of a vehicle is between 550 and 1600 rpm.
In a typical day, a vehicle's axle 1 load is between 2000 and 8000 kg.
In a typical day, a vehicle's axle 3 load is between 4500 and 7500 kg.
In a typical day, a vehicle performs 50 to 300 compaction cycles.
It is infrequent for a vehicle to complete fewer than 50 or more than 300 lifter cycles in a day.
It is unusual for a vehicle to take less than 0.08 hours or more than 0.2 hours to refuel in a day.

**Explanation:**

* The code follows the same structure as the example input text and Python3 code provided.
* Each rule is defined as a function that takes a single argument representing the relevant parameter and returns `True` or `False` depending on the condition.
* The conditions are derived from the textual context and are translated directly into Python3 code.
* Variable names are chosen based on the context of the rules.<eos>"

In a typical day, a vehicle's speed ranges from 0 to 80 km/h.
It is infrequent for a vehicle's engine speed to fall outside the range of 550 to 1600 rpm in a day.
In a typical day, a vehicle's axle 1 load is between 2000 and 8000 kg.
Each day, axle 2 carries between 7000 and 11500 kg of load.
In a typical day, a vehicle performs 50 to 300 lifter cycles.
Refueling a vehicle takes 0.08 to 0.2 hours in a typical day.
