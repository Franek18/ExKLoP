Input text:
Textual context: On a usual day, a vehicle travels between 20 and 110 km.
In a typical day, a vehicle's total operational time ranges from 2 to 10 hours.
Typically, a vehicle idles for 1 to 5 hours daily.
In a typical day, a vehicle spends 1 to 5 hours driving.
It is infrequent for a vehicle to make fewer than 20 stops or exceed 300 stops in a day.
In a typical day, a vehicle makes 20 to 250 stops with the PTO engaged.
On a typical day, a vehicle's speed varies between 0 and 80 km/h.
It is uncommon for a vehicle's engine speed to be outside the range of 550 to 1600 rpm in a day.
On a usual day, a vehicle's payload ranges from 0 to 11000 kg.
It is unusual for a vehicle to consume less than 10 dmÂ³ or more than 100 dmÂ³ of fuel in a day.
It is uncommon for a vehicle to perform fewer than 50 or more than 300 compaction cycles in a day.
In a typical day, a vehicle refuels for 0.08 to 0.2 hours.
