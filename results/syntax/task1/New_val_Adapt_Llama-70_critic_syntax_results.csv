Each day, axle 2 carries between 7000 and 11500 kg of load.
It is not typical for a vehicle to have a payload outside the range of 0 to 11000 kg in a day.
It is infrequent for a vehicle to complete fewer than 50 or more than 300 lifter cycles in a day.
It is unusual for a vehicle to take less than 0.08 hours or more than 0.2 hours to refuel in a day.

Textual context: In a typical day, a vehicle idles for 1 to 5 hours.
Normally, a vehicle makes 20 to 300 stops in a day.
A vehicle making fewer than 20 stops with PTO engaged or more than 250 stops in a day is uncommon.
It is rare for a vehicle to operate outside the speed range of 0 to 80 km/h in a typical day.
It is uncommon for a vehicle's engine speed to be outside the range of 550 to 1600 rpm in a day.
It is infrequent for axle 3 to carry less than 4500 kg or more than 7500 kg in a day.
A payload outside the range of 0 to 11000 kg in a day is unlikely for a vehicle.
In a typical day, a vehicle completes 50 to 300 compaction cycles.
On a usual day, refueling takes between 0.08 and 0.2 hours.

Input text:
Textual context: In a typical day, a vehicle's total operational time ranges from 2 to 10 hours.
On a normal day, the PTO operates for 0.2 to 5 hours.
It is infrequent for a vehicle to make fewer than 20 stops or exceed 300 stops in a day.
Usually, a vehicle makes 20 to 250 stops with the PTO engaged per day.
On a typical day, a vehicle's speed varies between 0 and 80 km/h.
In a typical day, a vehicle's axle 1 load is between 2000 and 8000 kg.
A payload outside the range of 0 to 11000 kg in a day is unlikely for a vehicle.
In a typical day, a vehicle's total fuel consumption is between 10 and 100 dm³.
In a typical day, a vehicle completes 50 to 300 compaction cycles.
On a normal day, a vehicle completes 50 to 300 lifter cycles.
On a usual day, refueling takes between 0.08 and 0.2 hours.

Input text:
Textual context: On a usual day, a vehicle travels between 20 and 110 km.
It is not typical for the PTO to be engaged for under 0.2 hours or over 5 hours in a day.
It is not common for a vehicle to drive for less than 1 hour or more than 5 hours in a day.
Each typical day, a vehicle stops between 20 and 300 times.
Usually, a vehicle makes 20 to 250 stops with the PTO engaged per day.
In a usual day, the engine speed of a vehicle is between 550 and 1600 rpm.
In a typical day, a vehicle's axle 1 load is between 2000 and 8000 kg.
In a typical day, a vehicle's axle 3 load is between 4500 and 7500 kg.
In a typical day, a vehicle performs 50 to 300 compaction cycles.
It is infrequent for a vehicle to complete fewer than 50 or more than 300 lifter cycles in a day.
It is unusual for a vehicle to take less than 0.08 hours or more than 0.2 hours to refuel in a day.

Input text:
Textual context: On a usual day, a vehicle travels between 20 and 110 km.
In a typical day, a vehicle's PTO is engaged for 0.2 to 5 hours.
During a normal day, a vehicle is driven for 1 to 5 hours.
A vehicle making fewer than 20 stops with PTO engaged or more than 250 stops in a day is uncommon.
It is rare for a vehicle to operate outside the speed range of 0 to 80 km/h in a typical day.
On a typical day, the load on axle 1 ranges from 2000 to 8000 kg.
Each day, axle 2 carries between 7000 and 11500 kg of load.
On a typical day, the load on axle 3 ranges from 4500 to 7500 kg.
A payload outside the range of 0 to 11000 kg in a day is unlikely for a vehicle.
In a typical day, a vehicle's total fuel consumption is between 10 and 100 dm³.
It is unusual for a vehicle to take less than 0.08 hours or more than 0.2 hours to refuel in a day.

Textual context: On a usual day, a vehicle travels between 20 and 110 km.
On a normal day, the PTO operates for 0.2 to 5 hours.
A vehicle idling for less than 1 hour or more than 5 hours in a day is not common.
It is uncommon for a vehicle to spend less than 1 hour or more than 5 hours driving in a day.
Normally, a vehicle makes 20 to 300 stops in a day.
In a typical day, a vehicle's speed ranges from 0 to 80 km/h.
It is infrequent for a vehicle's engine speed to fall outside the range of 550 to 1600 rpm in a day.
In a typical day, a vehicle's axle 1 load is between 2000 and 8000 kg.
Each day, axle 2 carries between 7000 and 11500 kg of load.
In a typical day, a vehicle performs 50 to 300 lifter cycles.
Refueling a vehicle takes 0.08 to 0.2 hours in a typical day.

In a typical day, a vehicle makes 20 to 250 stops with the PTO engaged.
It is unusual for a vehicle to operate at speeds outside the range of 0 to 80 km/h in a day.
On a typical day, a vehicle's engine operates at 550 to 1600 rpm.
It is not common for axle 1 to carry less than 2000 kg or more than 8000 kg in a day.
It is infrequent for axle 3 to carry less than 4500 kg or more than 7500 kg in a day.
It is not common for a vehicle to perform fewer than 50 or more than 300 compaction cycles in a day.
It is not typical for a vehicle to refuel in less than 0.08 hours or more than 0.2 hours in a day.

Input text:
Textual context: On a usual day, a vehicle travels between 20 and 110 km.
It is not typical for the PTO to be engaged for under 0.2 hours or over 5 hours in a day.
Normally, a vehicle makes 20 to 300 stops in a day.
In a typical day, a vehicle makes 20 to 250 stops with the PTO engaged.
In a typical day, a vehicle's speed ranges from 0 to 80 km/h.
It is uncommon for a vehicle's engine speed to be outside the range of 550 to 1600 rpm in a day.
On a typical day, the load on axle 1 ranges from 2000 to 8000 kg.
It is infrequent for axle 3 to carry less than 4500 kg or more than 7500 kg in a day.
A payload outside the range of 0 to 11000 kg in a day is unlikely for a vehicle.
Typically, a vehicle consumes 10 to 100 dm³ of fuel in a day.
On a normal day, a vehicle completes 50 to 300 lifter cycles.
Refueling a vehicle takes 0.08 to 0.2 hours in a typical day.

Input text:
Textual context: In a typical day, a vehicle travels between 20 and 110 km.
It is unusual for the PTO to be engaged for less than 0.2 hours or more than 5 hours in a day.
Typically, a vehicle idles for 1 to 5 hours daily.
During a normal day, a vehicle is driven for 1 to 5 hours.
Each typical day, a vehicle stops between 20 and 300 times.
Usually, a vehicle makes 20 to 250 stops with the PTO engaged per day.
In a typical day, a vehicle's speed ranges from 0 to 80 km/h.
It is uncommon for a vehicle's engine speed to be outside the range of 550 to 1600 rpm in a day.
On a typical day, the load on axle 2 ranges from 7000 to 11500 kg.
In a typical day, a vehicle's payload ranges from 0 to 11000 kg.
It is not common for a vehicle to perform fewer than 50 or more than 300 compaction cycles in a day.
On a usual day, refueling takes between 0.08 and 0.2 hours.

A vehicle spends 1 to 5 hours driving each typical day.
In a typical day, a vehicle makes 20 to 300 stops.
Usually, a vehicle makes 20 to 250 stops with the PTO engaged per day.
In a typical day, a vehicle's engine speed is between 550 and 1600 rpm.
In a typical day, a vehicle's axle 1 load is between 2000 and 8000 kg.
It is unusual for axle 2 to carry less than 7000 kg or more than 11500 kg in a day.
On a typical day, the load on axle 3 ranges from 4500 to 7500 kg.
Typically, a vehicle consumes 10 to 100 dm³ of fuel in a day.
It is uncommon for a vehicle to perform fewer than 50 or more than 300 compaction cycles in a day.
It is not typical for a vehicle to refuel in less than 0.08 hours or more than 0.2 hours in a day.

Input text:
Textual context: In a typical day, a vehicle travels between 20 and 110 km.
A vehicle's PTO operates for 0.2 to 5 hours in a typical day.
Typically, a vehicle idles for 1 to 5 hours daily.
It is uncommon for a vehicle to spend less than 1 hour or more than 5 hours driving in a day.
Each typical day, a vehicle stops between 20 and 300 times.
Each day, a vehicle makes 20 to 250 stops with the PTO in use.
On a normal day, a vehicle’s speed ranges from 0 to 80 km/h.
In a usual day, the engine speed of a vehicle is between 550 and 1600 rpm.
It is infrequent for axle 3 to carry less than 4500 kg or more than 7500 kg in a day.
On a normal day, a vehicle performs 50 to 300 compaction cycles.
It is unlikely for a vehicle to complete fewer than 50 or more than 300 lifter cycles in a day.
It is unusual for a vehicle to take less than 0.08 hours or more than 0.2 hours to refuel in a day.

Normally, a vehicle makes 20 to 300 stops in a day.
It is rare for a vehicle to operate outside the speed range of 0 to 80 km/h in a typical day.
In a usual day, the engine speed of a vehicle is between 550 and 1600 rpm.
Each day, axle 2 carries between 7000 and 11500 kg of load.
It is rare for a vehicle to consume less than 10 dm³ or more than 100 dm³ of fuel in a day.
On a normal day, a vehicle completes 50 to 300 lifter cycles.
Refueling a vehicle takes 0.08 to 0.2 hours in a typical day.
