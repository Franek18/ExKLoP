**Corrected code:**

  2 ≤ op ∧ op ≤ 10

-- On a typical day, the load on axle 3 ranges from 4500 to 7500 kg.

def r3 (r1 r2 : Nat -> Bool) (x1 x2 : Nat) : Bool :=
  ¬((r1 x1) ∨ (r2 x2))
```

**Explanation of the corrections:**

* The original code used `∧` (conjunction) in the `r3` rule to combine the two conditions. However, the natural language premise suggests that **any** one of the conditions being violated is enough to identify the day as abnormal. Therefore, we replaced `∧` with `∨` (disjunction).
* The corrected code uses the appropriate logical operators to represent the given premises accurately.<eos>";Correct syntax;True;False
