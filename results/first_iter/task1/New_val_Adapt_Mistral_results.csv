Textual context: During a typical day, a vehicle covers a distance of 20 to 110 km.
It is unlikely for a vehicle to operate for less than 2 hours or more than 10 hours in a typical day.
It is not common for a vehicle to drive for less than 1 hour or more than 5 hours in a day.
It is unlikely for a vehicle to make fewer than 20 stops or more than 300 stops in a day.
Each day, a vehicle makes 20 to 250 stops with the PTO in use.
In a typical day, a vehicle's engine speed is between 550 and 1600 rpm.
It is infrequent for axle 3 to carry less than 4500 kg or more than 7500 kg in a day.
It is not typical for a vehicle to have a payload outside the range of 0 to 11000 kg in a day.
Typically, a vehicle consumes 10 to 100 dm³ of fuel in a day.
It is unlikely for a vehicle to complete fewer than 50 or more than 300 lifter cycles in a day.
It is unusual for a vehicle to take less than 0.08 hours or more than 0.2 hours to refuel in a day.

Textual context: On a usual day, a vehicle travels between 20 and 110 km.
In a typical day, a vehicle's PTO is engaged for 0.2 to 5 hours.
During a normal day, a vehicle is driven for 1 to 5 hours.
A vehicle making fewer than 20 stops with PTO engaged or more than 250 stops in a day is uncommon.
It is rare for a vehicle to operate outside the speed range of 0 to 80 km/h in a typical day.
On a typical day, the load on axle 1 ranges from 2000 to 8000 kg.
Each day, axle 2 carries between 7000 and 11500 kg of load.
On a typical day, the load on axle 3 ranges from 4500 to 7500 kg.
A payload outside the range of 0 to 11000 kg in a day is unlikely for a vehicle.
In a typical day, a vehicle's total fuel consumption is between 10 and 100 dm³.
It is unusual for a vehicle to take less than 0.08 hours or more than 0.2 hours to refuel in a day.
