Textual context: In a typical day, a vehicle's total operational time ranges from 2 to 10 hours.
On a normal day, the PTO operates for 0.2 to 5 hours.
It is infrequent for a vehicle to make fewer than 20 stops or exceed 300 stops in a day.
Usually, a vehicle makes 20 to 250 stops with the PTO engaged per day.
On a typical day, a vehicle's speed varies between 0 and 80 km/h.
In a typical day, a vehicle's axle 1 load is between 2000 and 8000 kg.
A payload outside the range of 0 to 11000 kg in a day is unlikely for a vehicle.
In a typical day, a vehicle's total fuel consumption is between 10 and 100 dm³.
In a typical day, a vehicle completes 50 to 300 compaction cycles.
On a normal day, a vehicle completes 50 to 300 lifter cycles.
On a usual day, refueling takes between 0.08 and 0.2 hours.

In a typical day, a vehicle's speed ranges from 0 to 80 km/h.

On a typical day, the load on axle 1 ranges from 2000 to 8000 kg.
On a typical day, the load on axle 2 ranges from 7000 to 11500 kg.
A payload outside the range of 0 to 11000 kg in a day is unlikely for a vehicle.
It is unusual for a vehicle to consume less than 10 dm³ or more than 100 dm³ of fuel in a day.
